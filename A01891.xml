            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFULL M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iſaac Pennington,</hi> Alderman of the City of <hi>London,</hi> with the reſt of my loving Pariſhioners, and deare friends, the Inhabitants of Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> Colemanſtreete <hi>London,</hi> part and fellowſhip in the great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, with all Saints, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful, and deare in the Lord; right deare and precious are the bands of that relation, wherein a People and Paſtor
<pb facs="tcp:18542:3"/>meeting together, are made one; eſpecially when the lawes and termes of this relation are with all good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and intireneſſe of affection, managed and obſerved on both ſides. If it were put upon the file, (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) it would bee none of the eaſieſt queſtions now on foot, and under diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in the world, to determine, whether it be matter of greater
<pb facs="tcp:18542:3"/>ſatisfaction, to men of ſpirituall conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either to lead, or to be led, to that perfect happineſſe which ſtands in the full fruition of God in Chriſt. That both the one and the other, are of very high and excellent contentment to the mindes of men ſo compoſed, is a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which needes coſt a man little in ſtudy or thoughts, to beleeve. Doubtleſſe
<pb facs="tcp:18542:4"/>there is no ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of actives and paſsives under Heaven, betweene which the mutuall penetration is mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more gratefull and acceptable, or wherein there is more ſatisfaction given and received on both ſides, then betweene them. He that is not himſelfe called to the place or office of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in the Church of Chriſt, cannot (with wiſdome) but
<pb facs="tcp:18542:4"/>put it in head or front of his deſires, to eat of the labours, &amp; march towards Heaven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of ſuch a Miniſter, of whom he hath this precious aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that his heart is with his ſoule, and that he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes in birth wich him, till Chriſt bee framed in him, that is willing to doe and ſuffer all things, to make him partaker of the Goſpell with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And for him
<pb facs="tcp:18542:5"/>whom God hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated to ſerve him in the Goſpell of his deare Son, and for the worke of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if he be capable of his owne greateſt comfort and glory, the greateſt joy and ſtrength of his deſire muſt needs be, to help to repleniſh and fill thoſe many Manſions in Heaven with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of his owne; to goe before ſuch a people that is willing to follow him, round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="tcp:18542:5"/>and cloſe up, in all the waies of life, whoſe reſolutions &amp; ingagements for that great piece of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, laugh all the glory, pleaſures, and contentments of the world, in the face to ſcorne; and are too great, and deep to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde hand in the things of their peace, with running out of the way for the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde. What hath been ſaid concerning
<pb facs="tcp:18542:6"/>the ſheep, is too inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent a ſaying, to finde enmity or contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from any man. To deſire the greateſt faithfulneſſe, and the deareſt tenderneſſe of affection in him, to whom, under God, a man chuſeth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that invaluable treaſure of his ſoule, is no ſuch profound, or maſter-piece of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: but that it may well be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be incident to men that have but the
<pb facs="tcp:18542:6"/>firſt fruits of the firſt fruits of the Spirit, or that have but begun to be a little jealous and thoughtfull, that they have ſoules in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which will not doe well in hell. Wherefore (to leave this aſſertion to ſhift for it ſelfe, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any further care of plea, or proofe for it) what hath been ſaid concerning the Shepheard, ſeemes to admit more queſtion or diſpute. If <hi>Timothy</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18542:7"/>may ſave his owne ſoule, is he not well for one, whether hee ſaves others or no? or what great additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can it be to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, who otherwiſe approves himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and makes for the great Port of Heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a ſtreight courſe, both in Life and Doctrine, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a traine or retinue of his people with him? will it make any breach in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in heaven, that hee
<pb facs="tcp:18542:7"/>comes thither alone? Will not his Crowne of righteouſneſſe flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh upon his head, except it be watered with the ſalvation of others? Whether it be of any concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or reſentment or no, to a faithfull Miniſter, being once entred into his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters joy, and fully poſſeſt of that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſhall be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up of life, whether he hath ſtretched forth
<pb facs="tcp:18542:8"/>the hand of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, either to a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying, or to an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient or willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether he hath ſaved many or few, or none at all; certaine it is, that whileſt he is upon his Pilgrimage, &amp; clothed with fleſh; yea, and as it ſeemes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.19. ſomewhat fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even to the very gates and entring in to that compleat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality (whereinto there is no entrance
<pb facs="tcp:18542:8"/>till after the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the dead, and the ſentence of Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution paſſed from the mouth of the great Judge) it is a matter of great thoughts, and workings of heart, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the right hand or on the left hand unto him. Obey them (ſaith the Apoſtle in the former Scripture) that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſoules, as they that muſt give
<pb facs="tcp:18542:9"/>accompt, that they may doe it with <hi>Ioy,</hi> and not with <hi>Griefe,</hi> &amp;c. And in the latter, thus: For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoycing? Are not even yee in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming? For yee are our glory and joy. So that a teachable, wiſe, and tractable people, that know what to doe with the words of eternall life, beſides giving them the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:18542:9"/>are not only choice matter of hope (for the future) and of joy, yea, and of a Crowne of rejoycing, <hi>i. e.</hi> matter of the moſt weighty and ſolemne rejoycing, unto their faithfull Miniſter for the preſent, whileſt his dwelling is with fleſh, but even after he hath laid aſide this earthly Tabernacle, &amp; reſumed it againe in the Reſurrection, at the comming, and in the preſence of Jeſus
<pb facs="tcp:18542:10"/>Chriſt, they will be a glory and crowne of rejoycing, an annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Oyle of joy and gladneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, above his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. As on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a froward, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, careleſſe, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne flock, as they are a great abaſement, and ſorrow of heart to a good Shepheard for the preſent, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1, 3, 7.12.21. So will they be an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the laſt griefe, and heavineſſe unto
<pb facs="tcp:18542:10"/>him; yea, of ſuch a griefe and heavineſſe, that cannot (it ſeemes by the expreſsion of the holy Ghoſt) be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, neither by the richeſt, and moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able aſſurance, nor by the neareſt and moſt immediate approach, but only by the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all compleate enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the joy and glory of immortality it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Though I have no ground of confidence
<pb facs="tcp:18542:11"/>to put any ſuch great queſtion unto you, as <hi>Paul</hi> did (and well might) unto the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, to aske you, What hath your felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty been ſince my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and preaching the Goſpell unto you? yet this I cannot but profeſſe and teſtifie to the world, to the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and praiſe of the grace of God that hath been given you by my diſpenſation of the Goſpell towards you (let the tree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:18542:11"/>fall which way it will, whether to the North, or to the South, it ſhall neither hurt me nor you by the fall) that you have rejoyced in my light, and have been ready (many of you) if not to pluck out, and give your eyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, yet in the beſt and readieſt way of Chriſtian expreſsion, to ſignifie and ſeale the truth, life and power which you have ſeen, taſted, and
<pb facs="tcp:18542:12"/>felt in my Miniſtery. And that which I know not how to draw aſide to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſtruction, but only to make a demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and proofe of the naturalneſſe of your affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the truth it ſelf, delivered by me; though the iniquity of many hath aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt both, yet your love to neither hath waxed cold: which crowne of
<pb facs="tcp:18542:12"/>praiſe, I could willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enrich yet ſeven times more, and ſet it upon your heads; when I had done, if I knew how to worke upon it, without ſeeming (at leaſt) to ſoile others by way of complaint, and to make men offenders for perſonall wrongs: which is a ſtraine of too much effeminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in a Chriſtian, and little leſſe then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſtrength
<pb facs="tcp:18542:13"/>of other mens weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a mans owne ſtrength. Howſoever, my ſilence (whether upon this, or other conſideration) will be found no treaſon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the life, or dignity of your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and worthy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment therein: there is one greater then all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that will ſee that righteouſneſs of yours fully rendred unto you in due time.
<pb facs="tcp:18542:13"/>Truth is honeſt in her deepeſt poverty and diſtreſſe, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe borroweth or taketh of any man for her ſupport or reliefe in priſon, ſhe will pay double and treble when ſhe recovers her liberty, and entreth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into her glory. And feare not, he that would not leave the ſoule of his Sonne in hell, nor ſuffer his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One to ſee corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be as mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of, &amp; tender over
<pb facs="tcp:18542:14"/>his daughter Truth; and will give her beauty for aſhes in due ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>You (I confeſſe) have the advantage of me in opportunities many wayes, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsing your ſelves in point of affection. The giving of carnall and outward things, is both eaſier of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and leſſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſiniſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, then the diſpenſing of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things is. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb facs="tcp:18542:14"/>are oftentimes ſuſpected to preach the Goſpell out of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, or other pretences that are not good; but no man gives either ſilver or gold, but is preſumed to doe it of good will. Beſides, the work and labour of a Miniſter, is look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon (by the moſt) but as of a matter of courſe, and that which he is bound to doe; and no great thanke conceived to belong to it; but the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:18542:15"/>of a ſmall matter, where men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be free, (the rule of which free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is generally made the ſilence of the Lawes of Land and State) is no leſſe then matter of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration unto many: and two mites caſt into a Miniſters treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of free gift, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in the vulgar Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of men, twenty thouſands in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yea, the diligence and faithfulneſſe of
<pb facs="tcp:18542:15"/>good Miniſters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſucceſsively, who have abounded in this worke, may well be conceived to have abated the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of it with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and have cauſed it to ſeem now rather a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> then commendation. Whereas on the other hand, the generall baſeneſſe, and empty handedneſſe of men towards their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſets off a ſlender liberality with much
<pb facs="tcp:18542:16"/>luſtre and beauty: as the ſcarcity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and refreſhings in hell make a drop of water to coole his tongue, ſeem a great boone to the rich man.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe, my truſt and confidence is, concerning you that are ſpirituall, that you, by the light, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of my labours and paines amongſt you, having ſerved you now in the things of Jeſus Chriſt (well
<pb facs="tcp:18542:16"/>neare the terme of ſeven yeares) partly of my Doctrine, partly of my manner of life and converſation o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, can plainly and perfectly reade it written in the Tables of my heart, how deare you are unto me; and how high and glorious my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are in ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, whoſe faces are ſet towards heaven, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:18542:17"/>in exchange for your ſoules. I will not be further impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with you in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the cauſe of my indearments to you; upon this occaſion: I had rather give you an accompt of my heart towards you, in deeds then in words, in power then profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Neither ſhall I ever be troubleſome unto you for any greater meaſure of eſteeme, or approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with you, then
<pb facs="tcp:18542:17"/>what my carriage ſhall be reaſonably valued at, betweene a Paſtor and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. If you will pleaſe to interpret this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of mine eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all love, care, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects unto you, the burden and weight (I conceive) of what you doe herein, ſhall not need to lie more upon your affections, then your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:18542:18"/>actions ever come of with beſt content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſatisfaction to ſober men, that are ſo divided. If you had not been the firſt of my care and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, theſe firſt fruits (it is moſt like) had not fallen to your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: There is little in what is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to your view, but that which your eares have taſted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſome yeares ſince. You may by a freſh peruſall of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:18542:18"/>things (beſides the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect benefit of the knowledge reaped from them) be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned better to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and conſider the ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well of your hearts as memories, and to compare them together, ſo as to finde out, whether you be ſtronger in the one, or in the other, or in both ſtrong, or in both weake, alike. If you finde the ſinewes, ſtrength, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb facs="tcp:18542:19"/>of theſe things, in your inner man, ſo that whilſt you reade, you ſeem to ſee the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of the face of your owne ſoule, as in a Glaſſe, to reade the naturall hiſtory of your owne ſpirits: this is a pregnant and precious ſigne unto you, that your hearts are ſound, and their digeſtion of ſpirituall nouriſhment, of the beſt. If you meet with little here, but what you were able before,
<pb facs="tcp:18542:19"/>or without your read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to have uttered, and given an accompt of, this argues faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories alſo. If you lie under the power of theſe things, but have little or no command of the letter, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveneſſe, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in memory, but ſoundneſſe of heart (which is the great praiſe, glory, and comfort of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an) if the words, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
<pb facs="tcp:18542:20"/>and expreſsions remaine (for the moſt part) whole with you, but the marrow and fatneſſe, the ſpirit and life of them are not incorporated with your ſoules and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, you doe not finde that ſuch notions and apprehenſions as are fire in your bones, and make your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſpring and worke lively, when they doe but touch and come neare them: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of this
<pb facs="tcp:18542:20"/>ſigne is, that you have more of that which is leſſe, and leſſe of that which is more, that you have memories that would doe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily (indeed) with better hearts, and ſoules that would eſcape better with worſe memories. But I hope the beſt things of you. The great and mighty God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, who muſt teach you (and all the world beſides) to profit, whether by
<pb facs="tcp:18542:21"/>the eye, or by the eare, as well by writing, as ſpeaking, by reading, as hearing, in the knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and of the great things of your peace, make theſe meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as a Cloud of the latter raine unto you, to drop fatneſſe upon your ſoules; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to give out their ſtrength ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and freely unto you, that they may be felt by your ſelves, in the renewing and

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether hee hath done wel or ill, whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he was (be it my ſelfe, or ſome other) who was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall of making more Preſſe-worke of theſe Sermons, I conceive it is not worth the lighteſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb facs="tcp:18542:24"/>of thy thoughts, to conſider, judge, or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. If he hath done ill, doubtleſſe it cannot bee much: things that are weake, though otherwiſe unuſefull, yet will they ſerve for foile, to ſet off that which is ſtrong with more grace and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as the Thiſtle in Lebanon commends the ſtature and beauty of the Cedar in Lebanon. And the truth is, that many Bookes of worth and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue indeed, had need of ſome further recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<pb facs="tcp:18542:24"/>in one kinde or other, unto men, then their owne worth: they ſuffer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, and neglect at the hands of men, this notwithſtanding. Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies would be of great conſequence, if they could bring things of conſequence into requeſt.</p>
            <p>If he hath done well, thou thy ſelfe wilt eaſily be perſwaded to ſay, that this cannot be much: howſoever, in this point thou and I ſhall not much differ. Now then in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters where the difference
<pb facs="tcp:18542:25"/>is very ſmall, and almoſt imperceptible, a man may ſoone be out more in deliberation, then it is poſsible for him ever to recover, or get in againe by any reſolution. As in ſuing at Law for a trifle, the victory or conqueſt, with all the advantages, will not defray the one halfe of the coſt and charge of the Warre. I would gladly therefore ſave thee thy time and thoughts touching the premiſſes.</p>
            <p>Yet two things there
<pb facs="tcp:18542:25"/>are, which have their plea in their mouthes (ſuch as they are) for looſing their priſoners, and ſetting them at liberty in the world: The one is the occaſion of their Preaching; the other, their argument or Subject.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, it was the Anniverſary remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that great bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fought between Hell and Heaven, about the peace and ſafety of our Nation, on Novemb. <hi>5. 1605.</hi> wherein Hell was overthrowne, and Heaven
<pb facs="tcp:18542:26"/>and We rejoyced together. I have not (to my preſent remembrance) met with any thing publiſhed of late of any ſpeciall influence or tendency, to maintain the life and ſpirit of the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity &amp; joy of that day and deliverance. And pity it is that ſuch a Plant of Paradiſe ſhould wither, or languiſh for want of watering. Such a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, may, through the Mercy and Goodneſſe of God, prove a breeder, and become a joyfull Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many Children,
<pb facs="tcp:18542:26"/>like unto her ſelfe, if the hearts of our Nation did converſe with her more frequently, and more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately.</p>
            <p>The Argument or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject diſcourſed in theſe Sermons, is, the true Church her Intereſt in God, with all her mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. A Subject (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) that hath paſſed through many hands, and gained much of many: But the depth and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of it is ſuch, that it ſtill calleth upon the greateſt abilities of men,
<pb facs="tcp:18542:27"/>to be further ſought and inquired into. I aſſume nothing unto my ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the diſcoveries of other men: if thou meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt with any thing, that may excuſe or qualifie the Printing of the whole, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him that ſaid concerning a ſinfull City, <hi>Gen. 18.32.</hi> I will not deſtroy it for ten righteous mens ſake. If thou either deſireſt, or feareſt the ſight of any thing more of mine, thou maiſt make thine owne bargaine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by handling this piece
<pb facs="tcp:18542:27"/>accordingly. For as for me, I am not conſcious to my ſelfe, either of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, or backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of being made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique: the tongues and judgements of men (if they could agree) may eaſily over-rule me either way. It argues ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of ſpirit, to be importune upon the world, with a mans private conceptions: neither is it the beſt poſture, to put the world upon importunity with us, to purchaſe them, if they
<pb facs="tcp:18542:28"/>have a minde to them.</p>
            <p>Pardon me thus far; and that which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, I ſhall pray for thee, that thou maiſt with the Church, have Intereſt in God, and that this Intereſt may be eſtabliſhed and confirmed unto thee by the reading this piece, untill, through fulneſſe, thou breakeſt out with <hi>David,</hi> ſaying: <hi>The Lord is my Light, and my Salvation; Whom ſhall I feare?</hi> Pſa. <hi>27.1.</hi> And by this time, when thou knoweſt not whom,

               <p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18542:35"/>having delivered this our Nation, once, and again, and the third time alſo, with ſo high a hand, What other conſtruction can all the world make of ſuch his dealings with us, but that he delights to have his praiſes ſung, and his name magnified by the Engliſh Nation, more then all Lands beſides?</p>
               <p>Since therefore wee have ſo great a teſtimony of the Lords good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſule in this kinde, that he eſteemes our praiſes love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and deſires to heare our voice, let us addreſſe our ſelves to this great and honourable ſervice, let us fill the golden Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls of our hearts with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18542:36"/>theſe ſweet odors, and make a perfume before the Lord. To furniſh both you and my ſelfe herewith, I have made choice of this rich Veine in one of the Pſalmes of <hi>David,</hi> (as you have heard) wherein wee ſhall finde the praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God bearing very ſtrongly. The Pſalme it ſelfe, is <hi>in genere laudati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo,</hi> that is, of that kinde of <hi>Pſalme</hi> which is in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe framed for the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the name and praiſe of God.</p>
               <p>For the ſcope of the words no more but this:
<note place="margin">The ſcope</note> The Prophet a few ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes before, having ſet forth ſeverall delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18542:36"/>and victories, which God had given him and his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his heart being full with a Commemoration, and mention of ſo many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, of the love of the Lord, and admiration of his goodneſſe, in theſe two verſes (this and the former) not able to hold any longer, hee eaſeth himſelfe, and breakes forth into the praiſes of his God in this manner: <hi>Bleſſed be the God that dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ladeth us with his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the meaning of the words,
<note place="margin">and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the words.</note> a little will ſuffice, becauſe here is nothing ſcarce, either word or phraſe, but is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18542:37"/>every mans language. <hi>He that is our God,</hi> that is, that God with whom we are in Covenant, whom wee ſerve and worſhip. That God, whether true or falſe, which any Nation or People, or any private perſon chuſeth for a god, and beſtowes that feare, and love, &amp; other points of worſhip, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to God indeed, is uſually termed (and well may be) <hi>their</hi> or <hi>his God,</hi> becauſe ſuch a People, or ſuch a perſon, may ſeem to have a right and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the power of that God (whatſoever he is) for helpe and ſuccour in times of need. Out of ſome ſuch principle as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18542:37"/>this he ſpake, that ſaid,
<q>Iure venit cultos ad ſibi quiſ<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> deos;</q> that is, every man hath a right of comming to thoſe gods for ſuccour whom hee worſhips and ſerves.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>David</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe thus: <hi>He is our God, that is the God of ſalvation,</hi> it is as if he had ſaid: Other Nations and People have their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gods, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>There are that are called gods, whether in heaven, or in earth, Gods many, and Lords many.</hi> The <hi>Moabites</hi> have their god, the <hi>Amorites</hi> their god, the <hi>Sidonians</hi> their god; but (ſaith hee) <hi>He that is</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:18542:38"/>the God of Iſrael, <hi>He that is our God,</hi> he hath a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence above them all: He is the God <hi>of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> or (as the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall hath it in the plurall number) <hi>Salvations,</hi> that is, he only ſtands poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a Prerogative Royall of a true God, of a God indeed, namely <hi>Power</hi> to ſave thoſe that worſhip him, and that every way; it being one of the great royalties an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Crowne of heaven, as we have it Pſal. 3.8. <hi>Salvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salvation,</hi> that is, both the power and the act, of faving and delivering are ſo proper to the true
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18542:38"/>God, that they are not communicable with any creature, as is well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.11. <hi>I, even I, am the Lord</hi> (hee ſpeaks it once, and again, for the greater Emphaſis and weight, and that they which heare not the firſt voice, may heare the ſecond) <hi>And beſides mee there is no Saviour,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>none ſo great,</hi> ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp;c. but <hi>none at all.</hi> Therefore it ſeemes, but a needleſſe limitation of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in that ſpeech of his <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.29. <hi>There is no God that can deliver, or ſave after this manner:</hi> the truth is, none after that manner, or any other.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:18542:39"/>
               <p> It followeth: <hi>[And to God the Lord belong the iſſues of death]</hi> the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſounds, <hi>iſſues againſt death.</hi> This clauſe may ſtand under a double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, it may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be taken concerning the deſtruction of the wicked, or concerning the deliverance of the godly. According to the former interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſenſe falls thus: To the Lord God are, or doe belong <hi>Exitus mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> the iſſues: of death, that is, Judgement or death never goeth out againſt any man, but the hand of God is in it, it is of his fending: he hath death at that command,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18542:39"/>that hee can ſend him forth againſt any man.</p>
               <p>But I finde Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters rather inclining to the other Expoſition, which riſeth thus: <hi>[And to the Lord are the iſſues of death]</hi> that is, <hi>E morte, From,</hi> or <hi>out</hi> of death, ſo that there is no creature, one, or many, that can be brought ſo low, ſo neare unto death, or never ſo much under the power of death, but God hath not only one, or ſome few, but many ſecret wayes of eſcape for it, he hath choice of wayes, and meanes for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when it ſelfe is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay there is none at all: With him <hi>there is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18542:40"/>plenteous Redemption.</hi> Pſ. 130.7.</p>
               <p>In this ſenſe, this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter clauſe further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds thoſe words in the former <hi>[is the God of Salvation]</hi> and addes weight to them, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that God is not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and barely <hi>a God of Salvation,</hi> that can ſave if he ſets himſelfe about it in time, or if the danger and ſtrait bee not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing above meaſure. No, but though a man be in the greateſt, and deepeſt exigents, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined; though in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry jawes of death, yet God can make out an outſtretched arm of help,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18542:40"/>and reach him at any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whatſoever. This Interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being more agreeable to the frequent Method of the Pſalmes, wherein the latter mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the verſe is exege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, or expoſitory of the former, I rather chuſe to follow.</p>
               <p>In the words there are three things conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 1. The intereſt the Church and Children of God have in God, in the firſt words, <hi>He that is our God.</hi> 2. The benefit that redounds to the Church, or which the Church may aſſuredly expect; by meanes of this intereſt in God; <hi>Salvation,</hi> or <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,</hi> Many in number
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18542:41"/>and divers in kinde. 3. And laſtly, the extent of this benefit. This ſalvation is not from common, ordinary, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er dangers, but from the greateſt, and deepeſt, and dreadfulleſt of all, <hi>From</hi> death, or <hi>out</hi> of <hi>death</hi> it ſelfe, in thoſe words, <hi>To the Lord belong the iſſues of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe, the intereſt the Church hath in God, the God of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, poureth us out the bleſſing of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <hi>That the Church and Children of God have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and ſpeciall intereſt in God, ſo that he truly is, and may be called</hi> Theirs.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:18542:41"/>
               <p> The ſecond, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which is the great and ſingular benefit redounding unto the Church from this her intereſt in God, comes not much behinde it, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us directly to the Contemplation of this ſweet concluſion; <hi>That the Church of God may with all confidence and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of hope, expect from him Salvation, yea, Salvation upon ſalvation, Salvations of all kindes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and laſt thing conſiderable in the words, the <hi>extent</hi> of this great benefit, crowneth the ſoule with the fatneſs of this obſervation or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; <hi>That the Church of God, by vertue of her
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18542:42"/>intereſt in God may expect and ſhall certainly finde ſafety and deliverance by one meanes or other, not from common or leſſer dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers only, but from the greateſt and deepeſt of all:</hi> or more briefly thus, (if you pleaſe) <hi>The Church of God can never be brought ſo low, ſo neare death, and ruine, but that God hath ſtill choice of wayes, and meanes for her delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:18542:42"/>
               <head>CAP. II. <hi>Wherein the nature and importance of that propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, or intereſt which the Church hath in God, is declared.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>LEt us take the firſt thing (which is the groundworke of all) into conſideration: It is like we ſhall have occaſion in the handling hereof to draw in ſome of the beſt of the ſtrength in the other two. The great and important truth, which we are now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after, and ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, is this, <hi>The Church and people of God have a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18542:43"/>right, and intereſt in God, by meanes whereof he may truly and properly bee called theirs,</hi> or <hi>their God.</hi> For the opening and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging this point to the beſt advantage for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſervice; theſe foure things (I conceive) are requiſite to bee done: 1. To ſhew you what this intereſt is, what manner of intereſt it is, and what is the nature and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it. 2. To eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh you in the truth of the point, by the mouth and teſtimony of more witneſſes from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 3. To lay downe, &amp; conſider ſome grounds and reaſons of the point. 4. And laſtly, to bring all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18542:43"/>home into your boſomes in the uſe and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>For the firſt; That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt which the Holy Ghoſt here certifies, the Church and People of God to have in him, may be ſhadowed out unto you, by ſome ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription or overture as this: <hi>It is a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of himſelfe, which God by ſpeciall Covenant, and deed of gift</hi> (as it were) <hi>hath made over to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, willing to enter into ſuch Covenant with him, for every ſuch benefit and advantage to the creature, which in a lawfull and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular way, ſuch as becomes the Wiſdome and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18542:44"/>of God, may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the creature to its greateſt happineſſe, and perfection of beeing.</hi> I muſt not ſtand to weigh every particular in the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: I have conceived it ſomewhat more fully, and at large, that it might be better underſtood without further explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſtrength of it, and that which is moſt materiall to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, lyes in thoſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I call it a <hi>Propriety,</hi> or, <hi>A gracious propriety</hi> in God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which I make the end, or intent of ſuch propriety, (in reſpect of the creature) which is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18542:44"/>to have any thing done by God, <hi>towards the higheſt advancement of it, in a regular way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What the <hi>propriety of a thing is</hi> (in the ordinary acception of the word) we all know; it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which every man hath over that which is his, to diſpoſe of it as ſeemes beſt to himſelfe in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full way, for his good. Propriety in a thing, if it be full and perfect, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the thing unto us, and puts it into our hand to doe with it what wee pleaſe, according to any improvement, any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that may bee
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18542:45"/>made by it. If a man hath a propriety in Land, he may Sell, Let, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, Give, or Live upon it as he pleaſe; any thing hee may doe in a lawfull way, with that which is his owne, by the benefit of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety he hath in it. It is true, if a man ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to doe any thing with that which is his owne, never ſo much, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath as abſolute a propriety, as a man can be poſſeſſed of, that tends to the prejudice, or damage of the publique; here the Law riſeth up againſt him as a Lion in the way, and ſuffers him not to doe it. As for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18542:45"/>example: though a mans money be never ſo much his owne, hee may not hire men with it to ſerve him in any unlawfull, or ſinfull way, as to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Poyſon, Betray, or the like; (but: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the lawleſſe man, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin, having no Law upon him) but this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety is of perſons in things, which never is mutuall, or reciprocall: the things that a man owneth, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in, cannot be ſaid to have intereſt or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in him, or any power over him, except it be in a Metaphoricall, and Morall ſenſe: as wee uſe to ſay of great
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18542:46"/>Eſtates, the Silver and Gold of covetous, and baſe minded men, their money rather hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in them, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over them, then they over it; but this is not to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>There is another kinde of propriety (differing ſomewhat from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) which is in perſons, and is grounded either in naturall, or in civill rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Naturall, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Father and the Son; the Father hath a propriety in the Son, and the Son hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in the Father, ſo it is betweene Brother and Brother, and in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of that kinde.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18542:46"/>Civill, as betweene Prince and People, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Servant, &amp;c. The Prince hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in his People, and the People in their Prince; and ſo the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the Servant, and the Servant in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. This propriety is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies mutuall, and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall, though the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be at never ſo great a diſtance, either in civill, or naturall dignity. As for example: The wife hath a propriety in her husband, as well as the husband in the wife, and ſo the Subject in the Prince or Ruler, as well as the Prince in his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:18542:47"/>
               <p> Now that is here to be conſidered, that the intent of all theſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and proprieties, betweene perſon and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is the ſame that was in that other propriety of perſons in things and poſſeſſions. Namely, that every perſon that hath ſuch or ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in another, ſhould reape and enjoy every ſuch benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that by vertue of ſuch a relation, it could in way of equity and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon deſire or expect. And if there were no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full defects in perſons thus mutually proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted each in other, this would be done on every
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18542:47"/>ſide: A wife that hath propriety in a husband, ſhould receive continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from him every ſuch kindneſſe, ſupport, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and every other ſervice of love that may tend to her comfort and welbeeing, according to the uttermoſt ſtrength and power of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. And ſo on the other hand, the husband ſhould receive from the wife, the like meaſure of honour, reverence, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, &amp;c. by vertue of his intereſt and propriety in her.</p>
               <p>So when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures give unto the Church a right and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>priety in God (as both
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18542:48"/>in this place and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, as we ſhall heare preſently it doth) the meaning is, that looke whatſoever is in God, Power, Wiſdome, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Mercy, &amp;c. it may lawfully lay claime to all by vertue of this proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and may confidently expect (and ſhall not bee denied) that God will be unto it according to his excellent greatneſſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably for a God indeed, in due time, and in the beſt way, all that can be for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and benefit of the creature.</p>
               <p>So that ſuppoſe the creature it ſelfe (if it bee fit to make ſuch a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18542:48"/>as to explaine a truth of ſuch importance little queſtion need bee) ſuppoſe I ſay the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf were or could bee perſonally inveſted &amp; poſſeſſed with all that infinite <hi>Power, Wiſdome, Mercy, Iuſtice, &amp;c.</hi> which are in God, and could doe every whit as much for its owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, ſupport, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, or the like, as God himſelfe now can doe, it would doe no more, it could doe no more, then God will doe, yea, hath engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to do by that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, wherein he hath <hi>made over himſelfe,</hi> or <hi>a propriety in himſelfe</hi> to the creature.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:18542:49"/>
               <p> For this is the perfect and full extent of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of ſuch <hi>propriety</hi> as now we ſpeake of, of one perſon in another, when a man may with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence expect (and not be diſappointed) that any ſtrength, power, or abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of doing him good, lodging in ſuch a perſon, ſhall be as duly, as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully imployed for him, according to the lawes and binding conditions of that particular kinde of propriety which he hath in him, as if himſelfe had the managing and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all this in his own hands.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, that proprieties in perſons
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18542:49"/>amongſt creatures, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold out their full weight and meaſure. It is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a full expreſſion this way which <hi>Iehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> uſeth to <hi>Ahab, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horſes as thy horſes:</hi> meaning, he ſhould have as much uſe and ſervice of <hi>him</hi> and <hi>his,</hi> as if they were all <hi>his owne,</hi> 1 King. 22.4. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> Epheſ. 6.10. teacheth us excellently how to interpret and to conceive of this our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in God: <hi>Finally my Brethren be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power</hi> (or with the power) <hi>of his might.</hi> What is it <hi>to bee ſtrong in the Lord,</hi> and <hi>in,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:18542:50"/>or <hi>with</hi> the power of <hi>his might?</hi> Doubtleſſe the Apoſtles meaning duely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, riſeth to agreat height; he would have the Children of God, who beleeve in Chriſt, to take unto themſelves, and put on as great a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their ſalvation, and everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in regard of the mighty power of God to effect it, as if themſelves had the ſame Almighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and al-ſufficiency of power in their owne hand, to uſe and exerciſe at their owne deſires, and were as mighty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as God is, for the effectuall procuring of their owne happineſſe;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18542:50"/>
                  <hi>implying,</hi> that by meanes of this <hi>propriety in God,</hi> they have no more cauſe to feare or doubt any thing in this kinde then they ſhould or would have, if themſelves were omnipotent: <hi>this is to bee ſtrong in the Lord,</hi> and <hi>with the power of his might.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is ſomewhat the like expreſſion, Pſal. 84.5. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſtrength is in thee:</hi> That <hi>very ſtrength</hi> which is in God, by an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all faith and dependancy becomes the <hi>creatures,</hi> as truly as if it ſelfe were the ſubject of it. It is true in the relations we ſpeake of betweene crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18542:51"/>and creature, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>wife</hi> and <hi>husband, ſon</hi> and <hi>father, &amp;c.</hi> the propriety that mutually intercedes, gives right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally of as much as we ſpeake of. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the husband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wives husband (and ſo ſhe having a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in him) ſtands bound by the Law of God and Conſcience, by vertue of that propriety the wife hath in him, to doe as much for her good by all the power he hath, as the woman her ſelfe could doe, (I ſtill meane in a way of equity and right) if ſhee were wife, and husband both, or had all that power in every
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18542:51"/>kinde in her owne hand, which her husband now hath. And ſo back again, the wife ſtands bound in the ſame manner to her husband, by vertue of that propriety he hath in her: and ſo likewiſe it is betweene Son and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Father and Sonne.</p>
               <p>But though the due debt be as round a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as we ſpeake of, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from creature to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where any ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety intercedes, yet it can hardly be expected, that ever it will be either paid or received in full; the inſufficiency and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of the Creditor being ſuch as it is. And
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18542:52"/>though men and women be godly and upright, truly carefull, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable to pay all that is iſſuing from them to the proprietary, yet muſt allowance be made for humane frailties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. A Wife or Husband ſhall but wrong themſelves, to expect ſtrictly and punctually all that is due from either by the Law of that proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which each hath in other.</p>
               <p>But with God it is otherwiſe: he is every wayes ſufficient and able: we need not thinke of any Deductions, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batements to be made by him: Where he gives a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18542:52"/>propriety of, and in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, looke whatſoever the Law of that proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty interpreted in the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt favourableſt manner for the creatures benefit, can challenge, it is (and ſo he will eſteeme it accordingly) an honor done to him, to expect from him in full paiment to the utmoſt farthing. Now how great (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed infinite) that ſumm is, we have already uſed an expreſſion unto you, which ſets it forth to the full. And this for the firſt thing propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, What that right, or propriety is which the Church of God hath in him, what a mighty

               </head>
               <p>IN the next place, That they have indeed ſuch an intereſt as hath beene expreſſed, let us ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the holy Ghoſt doth not abundantly confirme it in the Scriptures. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many witneſſes that would rejoyce to ſpeake in this caſe, I ſhall deſire you to heare but two or three. Theſe are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18542:53"/>ſufficient to eſtabliſh the matter, though it be of greateſt importance. The tenour of the Covenant that God long ſince made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> expreſly containes this propriety we ſpeake of to the full. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant betweene mee and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their generations, for an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee,</hi> Gen. 17.7. And in the latter end of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe, repeating the ſumme of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he addeth; <hi>and I will be their God.</hi> This ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> (as S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Expoſition makes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18542:54"/>it cleare) are thoſe that walke in the ſteps of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and theſe are that Church of God we ſpeake of.</p>
               <p>Now, what is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and full meaning of this clauſe, <hi>I will be their God.</hi> In what, or in what degree would the Lord have <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed conceive their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be bettered and advanced by this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine (as it were) that God now made with them, in making over himſelfe unto them?</p>
               <p>There can be no other meaning, but to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: <hi>I will be their God,</hi> that is, I will be ready at all times with my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretched
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18542:54"/>arme, my Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, to helpe them, to relieve them, to provide for them, to doe them good every wayes, according to my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and excellency.</p>
               <p>There is a greater Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis and weight in it (as I conceive) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that he would be <hi>a God</hi> unto them, then if he had ſaid he would bee <hi>a Friend,</hi> yea, then if hee had ſaid hee would bee a <hi>Father,</hi> as appeares by ſuch other places where both theſe expreſſions are uſed together of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>a Father</hi> unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and being <hi>a God,</hi> this being ſtill put in the laſt place, as more weighty,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18542:55"/>and adding ſomewhat unto the former, Joh. 20.17. <hi>I aſcend unto my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and your Father, and to my God, and to your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For although for a creature to receive ſuch a promiſe from God, that he would be a <hi>Father</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, may imply as much in a direct and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conſequence, as if hee had ſaid he would bee <hi>a God</hi> unto him: yet hee muſt reaſon a little, to come at the full appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion hereof: he muſt conſider how great hee was that made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of being a Father unto him; the word <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> doth not carry as much in it as the other
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18542:55"/>word, <hi>God,</hi> doth: though comming from the mouth of God, it drawes as much after it.</p>
               <p>When he promiſeth, or covenanteth with the creature to be a <hi>God</hi> unto it, he promiſeth to doe all things to it, and for it, anſwerable to an infinite goodneſſe and power, ſuch as are proper to a God; elſe he could not properly bee ſaid to bee <hi>their</hi> God, or <hi>a God</hi> unto them, but only in part, or a piece of a God; to bee unto them, or to doe for them, only according to the line and proportion of a creature: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to be unto them as <hi>Abraham</hi> was unto
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18542:56"/>
                  <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to give them <hi>an earthly inheritance;</hi> or as <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> to the people, <hi>an earthly Deliverance;</hi> or as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Solomon,</hi> an <hi>earthly Kingdome:</hi> any of theſe, or all together will not make up the ſumme of thoſe words, to be a God unto them. This would rather be to be <hi>Abraham, Ioſhuah,</hi> or <hi>David</hi> unto them; he is not their God, except his infinite goodneſſe, and omnipotency be theirs; for what is God without theſe?</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>David</hi> often in this Booke of Pſalmes profeſſeth and triumpheth in this peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar intereſt himſelfe had
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18542:56"/>in God, as a member of his Church, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth likewiſe the generall title, and right which the Church of God hath in him. Pſal. 144.15. <hi>Bleſſed be the people that be in ſuch a caſe; yea, bleſſed is that people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> Where the Prophet doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeake to the point in hand, to confirme and eſtabliſh that, namely, that the Lord is the God of his People &amp; Church, (for it is cleare he ſpeaks of theſe, <hi>theſe</hi> are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon whoſe heads he ſets this crowne of bleſſedneſſe) but withall more particularly, and fully he informes in what
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18542:57"/>ſenſe it muſt needs be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, where it is ſaid that God is the <hi>God of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> or that they have <hi>a propriety in him;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the ſenſe already expreſſed: he is theirs <hi>quantus quantus eſt,</hi> as <hi>great,</hi> as <hi>glorious,</hi> as <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> as <hi>excellent</hi> every way as he is. For we ſee hee pronounceth them bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in reſpect of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, or intereſt of theirs in God. <hi>Bleſſed is that people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> Now if their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt extended no further but to ſome inferiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of his power, the people that had ſome creature for their God, might be as bleſſed as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18542:57"/>they. <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Courtiers had him for their God, they had an intereſt in their King, and (no queſtion) he did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things for them, for their advancement in the world, but theſe were not bleſſed by any ſuch inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, becauſe <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> could not bee a <hi>God</hi> unto them.

               <head>CAP. IV. <hi>Whereing foure ſeverall Grounds or Reaſons of the Churches propriety in God, are laid downe, and opened.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AMongſt many conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations that might be laid downe as grounds or reaſons of this intereſt and propriety of the Church in God, I ſhall only inſiſt upon foure which are moſt obvious, and neareſt at hand to every mans thoughts.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, the love, and affection that God bare unto this Church, and people of his, yea,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18542:58"/>even before they were either Church or People unto him, or he theirs, in any ſuch relation as now they ſtand. It is true that now he loves them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>his</hi> in that peculiar maner that now he hath made them <hi>his,</hi> by the great coſt and charge both of his Son, and Spirit beſtowed on them: And yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive hee loves them as much (or rather more) becauſe he <hi>is theirs,</hi> then becauſe they <hi>are his.</hi> An upright and juſt man loves his promiſe and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right dealing more, then he doth his poſſeſſions or eſtate, as <hi>David</hi> in effect affirmeth, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18542:59"/>Now God loving his People becauſe they are his, loves them as a wiſe and upright man loves his inheritance or poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; which kinde of love, in the expreſſion of it, is capable of ſubjection to a Superiour, and muſt give place when time is: but loving them becauſe he is <hi>theirs,</hi> and they have a propriety <hi>in him,</hi> hee loves them as he doth his owne truth and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in the performance of his promiſe; which is a ſoveraigne love, and to be commanded &amp; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by nothing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p>And if God had not loved his Church and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18542:59"/>People before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came either the one or the other unto him, it is certaine hee would never have loved them; becauſe it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any, or all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes whatſoever either in heaven or earth, ſhould. ever have made a Church or People unto him of perſons defiled with ſin, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and aſſiſtance, nay, without the precur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and ducture of his owne love thereunto. Of this love of God towards his Church, before their Church-making or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neare to him in any ſuch relation, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaketh exprefly.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18542:60"/>John 3.16. <hi>So God loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That love of God, in the wombe whereof Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as given unto the world, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently unto thoſe, of whom his Church is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and built, (for no man can imagine theſe to bee here excluded, though neither doe I conceive them to bee ſolely and preciſely intended) was conceived, muſt needs go before the raiſing of this Temple unto him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was actually done by Jeſus Chriſt as given (at leaſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.) So John 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18542:60"/>ſhall come unto me,</hi> and ver. 44. <hi>No man can come unto me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> And again ver. 45. <hi>Every man therefore that hath heard, and learned of the Father, commeth unto me.</hi> Now all theſe, and ſuch like acts of God, acted and exerciſed upon men, not yet actually brought home to Chriſt, but for and about the bringing of them home to him, as giving to Chriſt, drawing to Chriſt, teaching, &amp;c. are apparently the fruits, or acts of ſuch a love in God towards them; which hath precedency both in order of nature, and time
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18542:61"/>alſo, before that love of his wherewith he loveth them as being in Chriſt; that is, as being made a Church and People unto him. Thus it is evident, that there was in God a love towards his Church and People before the light of either of theſe, or the like relations aroſe upon them. Let us then proceed in our Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
               <p>The nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of love (we know) that is reall and in truth, is to be <hi>bountifull,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loveth the Son,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, John 3.35. <hi>and hath given all things into his hand.</hi> When the love
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18542:61"/>and affection of God is caſt upon the creature, <hi>Himſelfe, Son, Spirit,</hi> and all he hath, ſhall not ſtay behinde. <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Gift, affection,</hi> and <hi>expreſsion</hi> in God we ſhall ſtill finde together, John 3.16. <hi>So God loved the world that he gave, &amp;c.</hi> and 2 Theſ. 2.16. <hi>Even the Father which hath loved us, and given us everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</hi> So S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, ſaith thus; <hi>Who hath loved me, and given himſelfe for me.</hi> Gal. 2.20. Now the love of God to his Church being the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt tranſcendent love, he muſt finde out an expreſſion or gift anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18542:62"/>to it, otherwiſe there would be loſſe of ſome part of the glory belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. For he cannot be praiſed and magnified but according to ſuch a meaſure thereof as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to the creature. The gift that ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the height, depth, breadth, length of this love to the full, can be no other then himſelfe, and that as God; all other would be defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. If there had beene any thing greater, any thing better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, it is like we ſhould have had it, and that had been fitteſt for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe herein.</p>
               <p>I am drawne to uſe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18542:62"/>ſuch an expreſſion unto you, (which I confeſſe might otherwiſe ſeeme ſomewhat hard, and ſtrange) becauſe I finde one of like importance in a matter not much unlike, or rather indeed very neare to that we now ſpeake of, in that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Heb. 6.13. <hi>When God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>made the promiſe to Abraham, becauſe he had no greater to ſweare by, he ſware by himſelfe.</hi> [Becauſe he had no greater, &amp;c.] if that be the ſpirit of the words which I conceive, (neither can I apprehend what other it ſhould be with any tolerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of Reaſon) they
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18542:63"/>are a ſtraine of ſpeech to be heard out of the mouth of an infinite God, fearefully high and glorious. <hi>Becauſe he had no greater to ſweare by,</hi> therefore <hi>he ſware by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi> clearely implying, that if he had a greater then himſelfe, he would have ſworne by him. For this is the reaſon deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in plaine and expreſſe tearmes why he ſware <hi>by himſelfe,</hi> becauſe he had <hi>no greater:</hi> As if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Al-ſufficiency of God himſelfe did not give him that ſatisfaction which he deſired, for the confirmation of his oath, made to the heires of promiſe, in reſpect of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18542:63"/>weakneſſe and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous backwardneſſe of their hearts to beleeve, unto perfect eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and aſſurance: but he would have had a greater if it might have beene, and have paſſed by himſelf; if there had been <hi>infinitum, infinito infinitius,</hi> this had been an only choice for him in this caſe.</p>
               <p>To ſay that the words imply only this, <hi>Gods greatneſſe</hi> above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, makes the ſenſe but cold and wateriſh. For it is not the ſcope of the Holy Ghoſt here to declare the greatneſſe of God, but rather the greatneſſe of <hi>his deſire to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18542:64"/>ſatisfie the heires of promiſe</hi> (as they are called) that is his Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with the ſtrongeſt and mightieſt conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons touching the truth and ſtableneſſe of that promiſe of life by Chriſt. And for this purpoſe the words in the ſenſe given are (as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) of mighty impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. So deſirous he was, that his children ſhould be filled with faith, and the ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of it, that if hee had had any greater, or more effectuall meanes for the bringing it to paſſe, they had been uſed; and the words thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, are but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18542:64"/>and breaking out of the mighty power of that love of his towards his Children, which all this while we ſpeake of, which moves him to give his owne ſelfe unto them; if he had <hi>any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then himſelfe,</hi> they ſhould have had it; but for <hi>himſelfe</hi> they ſhall be ſure of. As we heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Chriſts love men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by S. <hi>Paul, Who loved me, and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for me:</hi> Like love, like bounty, like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, like expreſſion. Thus you ſee the love and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in God towards his Church to be one cauſe or reaſon why he gives them this intereſt and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18542:65"/>propriety in himſelfe, which the Doctrine ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Ground of the point is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The <hi>gift,</hi> or beſtowing of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> upon the world, <hi>So God loved the world, that hee gave his only begotten Son, &amp;c.</hi> as you heard before, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. Though the love of God to his Church was the <hi>Baſis,</hi> or prime cauſe of that propriety it now hath in him, yet was it not either the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or immediate cauſe thereof. This affection of his, notwithſtanding they were yet afarre off (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes) and lay at as great a diſtance as is between heaven and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18542:65"/>earth, from being a Church or holy People unto him, from having any ſuch peculiar intereſt or propriety in him. Sin had ſeparated (and that with a high hand) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and them, and had fixed a great gulfe betwixt the one and the other (moveable on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by him that hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to remove the earth out of his place) which kept them aſunder from comming one at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. God could not reach or come at his creature with any other expreſſion of his love, till this gulfe was removed, till ſin that hindered was taken out of the way:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18542:66"/>much leſſe was it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the creature to have made any approach neare unto him to have gained any thing upon him, or in him, till then.</p>
               <p>Now to fill up this vaſte, dreadfull, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring gulfe, and ſo to make the way paſſable from God to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture back again unto God, there was nothing elſe to be found in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or earth of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, or any wayes commenſurable thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but only one, that might lawfully <hi>count it no robbery to be equall with God,</hi> being God himſelfe <hi>bleſſed for ever.</hi> The
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18542:66"/>infinitely wiſe, juſt, and righteous God, could have found no other conſideration of value and weight ſufficient to have built a diſpenſation of that moſt righteous and juſt Law of his upon, <hi>[In the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt die the death]</hi> but only the death of his owne only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
               <p>Had all other creatures in heaven and earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented together in one to have given out their ſtrength and beeings to the uttermoſt, to have raiſed a conſideration, or reaſon amongſt them why God ſhould have paſſed over thoſe words
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18542:67"/>of his, as if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beene ſpoken, ſhould have let fall that ſolemne intermination or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his to the ground, never to have executed what he had threatned, the wiſdome of God doubtleſſe, and zeale to his glory would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed it, and laughed it to ſcorne (whatſoever poſſibly it might have amounted unto) and would have beene more ready to have fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mediators and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders together with fiery indignation, then any wayes relented, or ſtood ſo much as to conſider what he had to doe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tender of any ſuch
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18542:67"/>propoſitions unto him. It was no worke, no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking for creatures to ſalve the glory of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdome and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, in caſe he ſhould let ſuch words of his goe for nought, and vaniſh into the winde, which were uttered with ſuch ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, upon ſuch juſt and righteous grounds in the ſight of heaven and earth. It might juſtly have been thought that God had prized ſuch words as thoſe at a low and under rate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently undervalued himſelfe in the bargaine, if he had ſold them at any ſuch rate or price as the creature could have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:18542:68"/>
               <p> But the death and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his owne Son, this was a price that weighed ſomewhat like in his hand: upon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration hereof it was no waies grievous unto him, to diſpenſe with his Law, and ſuſpend the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof for ever, as far as it concernes thoſe that ſhall unfainedly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this ineſtimable grace of his, who hath thus bought them from under ſo heavy a curſe and condemnation. It is not the leaſt prejudice or diſparagement to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdome or Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of God, or the leaſt diminiſhing of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any of his Lawes,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18542:68"/>or threatnings whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to let Lawes and threatnings ſleep upon ſuch a Pillow as this is, and not to be put into execution upon the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ſuch a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as this.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee how <hi>the gift of Ieſus Chriſt</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to bring about this great and wonderfull thing in the world, that ſinfull men and women, the generation of which the Church of God is made, ſhould have this deare intereſt and propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in him. God not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his love to his People, before they were a People unto him,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18542:69"/>had yet no other way to communicate himſelfe in any grace or favour unto them, much leſſe to make them his Church, and give them ſo deepe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him, but only by the living way of the death and ſufferings of his owne Son, his zeale to his owne glory in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he had ſaid, in executing what he had threatned, would have eaten up and devoured all this affection to them, had it not fed upon the death of Chriſt, and been therewith ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third Ground or Reaſon is the great and <hi>gracious Covenant</hi> that God himſelfe hath made
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18542:69"/>with men to this effect or purpoſe: He hath made over himſelfe unto them as by a deed of gift, by an everlaſting Covenant, for a poſſeſſion, portion, or an inheritance. He hath power to diſpoſe of himſelfe in this kinde, or any other, (for unto whoſe will can he be in ſubjection but unto his owne?) and this is the gracious diſpoſition he hath pleaſed to make of himſelfe, he thinkes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe well beſtowed on men, and will not repent of it for ever. There is nothing in the Covenant, nor about the making of it, that any wayes can give occaſion to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18542:70"/>or altering of it. He was at liberty in the making of it, and was no wayes forced upon it, the creature was far enough from ſoliciting him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, from enforcing any ſuch thing upon him, as far in will, as in power otherwiſe. This Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is that which holds and keepes him cloſe to his Church, when other bands are ſomewhat looſe, as Pſal. 105.8. <hi>He hath alway remembred his Covenant.</hi> So ver. 42. When the People had provoked him in the Wilderneſſe, and he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe wrought ſtill for them, and did them good, the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18542:70"/>gives this reaſon for it, <hi>For he remembred his holy Promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Covenant of God by which he hath diſpoſed himſelfe to his Church in reſpect of the different expreſſions of it, may be conceived to be two-fold: (Though it is true that both theſe are in effect and for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance but the ſame)</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Conditionall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Poſitive, and <hi>abſolute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former is made and eſtabliſhed, not with the Church of God alone, but together with them, with the whole world. There is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture under heaven, but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18542:71"/>God hath thus far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned or covenanted with it, that if it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and accept of Jeſus Chriſt from his hand, he will receive it, and be a God unto it. This Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (or rather this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) the Scripture often mentioneth. <hi>Goe ye into all the world</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to his Apoſtles) <hi>and preach the Goſpel to every creature under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Marke 16.15. <hi>He that beleeveth and is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhall be ſaved, &amp;c.</hi> Preach the Goſpell to every creature, <hi>namely,</hi> that is capable of the things you preach, or of the great bleſſing offered
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18542:71"/>in your preaching to the world.</p>
               <p>Happily he uſeth a terme of a far larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in ſignification, then ſtrictly to include and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the perſons intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, namely, reaſonable creatures, Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for this reaſon: That ſo the Apoſtles in the firſt offer and tender of the Goſpell to men, might not be any wayes ſtraightened in reſpect of Conſcience, nor any wayes diſcouraged in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of hope, but what kinde of people ſoever they ſhould meet with in the world, though for their vileneſſe and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſſe of their lives and

               <p>It is a phraſe of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like importance with that 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. where S. <hi>Paul</hi> injoynes <hi>Timothy to preach the word,</hi> and <hi>to be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon.</hi> The expreſſion doth not imply that he would have <hi>Timothy</hi> doe any
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18542:74"/>thing (no not preach) unſeaſonably, or out of time: but only this, he would not have him too ſcrupulous, or too full of diſcretion, in diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and chuſing times, or places, or company, when, where, or to whom he ſhould preach: he would have him eſteeme all times, places, and companies ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for that worke, where he could finde any to heare him, and not aske any queſtions about ſuch matters as theſe for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake. But this by the way.</p>
               <p>Now, by <hi>preaching of the Goſpell,</hi> in this place, <hi>to every creature,</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18542:75"/>meanes nothing elſe but the propounding and preſſing that great and gracious Covenant of God to every man and woman in the world which he hath eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the world in Chriſt; namely, that upon their believing and receiving the Goſpel and Grace tendered, he will reject none of them, whatſoever they be, but will receive them into Grace, and be their God, and ſave them. For all this (and much more) is evidently contained in that conditionall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved, &amp;c.</hi> So in that of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18542:75"/>this conditionall Covenant is clearely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>So God loved the world, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him ſhould not periſh, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as for thoſe that take hold of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Covenant, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the condition thereof, that is, that true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe God makes a poſitive, and abſolute Covenant with them (without any further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) that he will be their God, and that they ſhall be his People. The truth is, this Covenant is directly and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly included in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. For a promiſe, or a Covenant conditionall,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18542:76"/>the performance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſuſpended upon the performance of ſuch, or ſuch a thing, by him with whom it is made, puts off and loſeth the nature of conditionall, and paſſeth over into that which is poſitive and abſolute, when the condition is performed. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>David</hi> covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Souldiers, that whoſoever ſhould ſmite the <hi>Iebuſites firſt,</hi> ſhould be <hi>Captaine,</hi> or Chiefe. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.6. made in effect an <hi>abſolute Covenant</hi> with <hi>Ioab,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now performed the condition, to make him Captaine. The like is to be thought of <hi>Caleb</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:18542:76"/>and his promiſe with his Souldiers alſo touching the mariage of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 1.12.</p>
               <p>And yet this abſolute Covenant of God with thoſe that actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, whereby he cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanteth, conveigheth, and maketh over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto them, though it be ſubſtantially and fully included in the conditionall, or generall Covenant, (as hath been ſaid) yet is it ſometimes diſtinctly expreſſed by it ſelfe, Exod. 6.7. <hi>I will take you for my people, and I will be your God:</hi> with divers ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Now that this <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God</hi> with men, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18542:77"/>with his Church, beſides the <hi>gift of Chriſt</hi> unto death, and that <hi>affection in God</hi> which procured it, was neceſſary as a meanes for him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh himſelfe over to his Church in ſuch a manner as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, may appeare, Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> becauſe it was not meet that he ſhould force himſelfe or his Son upon ſuch a creature as man is, or compell him by a ſtrong hand of power without gaining in his will and affection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, to receive and own him for his God.</p>
               <p>Nay, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecondly, the truth is, though God be of an omnipotent and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18542:77"/>power, yet can he not compell any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatſoever, indued with underſtanding and will, to receive and owne him againſt their will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is by an act of the Will that he is, and muſt be received: and ſo long as there remaineth an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe in a man to receive, or owne him for his God, impoſſible it is that he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or owned by him. So that now God muſt finde out a ſutable and fitting meanes to worke the heart or will of his creature to a deſire, or willingneſſe of receiving him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and laſtly,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18542:78"/>there was no other way or meanes conceivable (at leaſt none ſo con-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, proper, and ſweet) for ſuch a purpoſe, but only to propound and offer himſelfe in a free and gracious Covenant unto it: And ſo in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his owne infinite worth and excellency in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably above the emptineſſe and vanity of other things, to fall in with the effectuall work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Spirit, and hereby to awaken, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, raiſe, and ſtrengthen the heart and ſoule of his creature, to a willingneſſe of embracing and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his offer, that is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Thus you ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18542:78"/>Ground or Reaſon of the point, The graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Covenant of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth and laſt Ground we ſhall now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon, is the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the condition required in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, by the Church and People of God, namely, <hi>Their faith in God,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him: which is nothing elſe but their acceptance of him, according to his offer, for <hi>their God.</hi> This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing that makes him <hi>theirs,</hi> in that full and compleate manner that he is. He requires (upon the matter) nothing elſe of men to make himſelfe theirs, or to give them
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18542:79"/>the entire propriety (we ſpeake of) in himſelfe, but barely that, without which it is ſimply &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely impoſſible that he ſhould be theirs. God cannot be the God of any man, but his that is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take him, and have him for his God. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> could not poſſibly have been the God of the Philiſtims, nor <hi>Chemoſh</hi> the God of the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, &amp;c. except they had been willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and have them for their gods. All violence and compulſion in the world, exerciſed upon them, could not have made theſe Idols or falſe gods theirs, had
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18542:79"/>they not been willing and conſented to have acknowledged and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in that relation.</p>
               <p>Now then this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe in men to take, owne, and acknowledge the true God for their God (without which it is ſimply impoſſible, as hath been ſaid, that God ſhould be theirs) is all that is required to make him theirs, or to give them this ſpeciall and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar propriety in him. To believe in Chriſt, or rather in God through Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.44. is nothing elſe, being interpreted, but by the meanes or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord Chriſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18542:80"/>given unto them, really and unfainedly to take, and acknowledge the great God of heaven and earth for our God, and to addreſſe our ſelves unto him accordingly, as well inwardly with <hi>Love, Feare, Reverence, Dependance, &amp;c.</hi> as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in all manner of converſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſutable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And all this in the roote and firſt ſpring of it in the ſoule, is nothing elſe but a willingneſſe of minde to take and owne him for our God, or to truſt him, and make our dependance upon him. This diſpoſition being truly begotten, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually raiſed in the ſoul,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18542:80"/>containes all thoſe other things mentioned in the loines of it. Begotten and raiſed it is by the meanes of Jeſus Chriſt, and the word of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through him preached unto us: which word the Holy Ghoſt taking as it were in his hand, and managing it upon the ſoule, overcommeth the evill of the heart with the goodneſſe thereof: and ſmiting the crooked ſpirit of unbeliefe (which is the grand indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoule to accept of God for <hi>our God</hi>) with the glorious bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and power of the truth of it, createth a right ſpirit of Faith in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18542:81"/>the ſtead, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in the firſt breaking of it in the ſoul, but an aptneſſe and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to believe, that is, to accept and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the true God for our God. For before there can be a diſtinct and compleat act of Faith, or of accepting God for our God put forth in the ſoule, there muſt be in the order of Nature, an inclination or willingneſs to ſuch an act going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Otherwiſe God ſhould forſake his uſuall method of proceeding <hi>à minus perfectis, ad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiora,</hi> from leſſe perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to greater.</p>
               <p>Now as the firſt and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18542:81"/>weakeſt act of Faith, or accepting God for our God, being a reall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant whileſt it is yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, in the hidden man of the heart, gives a right and propriety in God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenour thereof: ſo doth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond act, or outward te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying to the world, a mans faith or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God, draw out the particular and ſpeciall benefits, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of this their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God. This ſets God on work to expreſſe himſelf freely unto them: he cares not now if all the world know that he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18542:82"/>is <hi>theirs.</hi> This faith of theirs in him openly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, makes them fit and meet to be beloved; I meane openly in the ſight of heaven, and earth and hell.</p>
               <p>True, God loves his Church and People (as was ſaid) before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or elſe they could never come to believe, <hi>Thine they were,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them unto me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 17.6.</note> But till they come to believe in him, other expreſſions of affection to them are but ordinary, as to other men. Though they bee his (in ſome ſenſe) yet he will not owne them openly till they be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18542:82"/>to be reputed his, that is, make their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him.</p>
               <p>The firſt differencing expreſſion of himſelfe to be <hi>theirs,</hi> and they <hi>his,</hi> is the giving of <hi>faith</hi> unto them: and when this is given, and begins to worke and be active in them, he cares not then what, or how great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings he gives them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The ſtumbling block is now removed out of the worlds way, all the world cannot but confeſſe it juſt and equall that God ſhould bee theirs that truſt in him. He was but a Heathen man that ſaid, it is right and equall that men
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18542:83"/>ſhould come to thoſe gods for help whom they ſerve. And ſo the Scripture ſtill gives the reaſon of thoſe ſpeciall and extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours vouchſafed by God unto his Church, to be their faith or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him. Eſay 26.3. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whoſe mind is ſtaid on thee, becauſe hee truſteth in thee.</hi> And Chap. 57.13. <hi>The winde ſhall carry them all away, vanity ſhall take them, but he that putteth his truſt in me, ſhall poſſeſſe the Land, and ſhall inherite my holy Mountaine.</hi> See Joh. 14.21. and Gen. 22.16, 17. &amp;c. The Jews, upon that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18542:83"/>paſſage, Exod. 29.43. <hi>And Moſes ſaw all the worke,</hi> (meaning of the Tabernacle, with all things belonging to it, and the ſervice thereof) <hi>and Moſes bleſſed them,</hi> have this obſervation: Worke is a great thing; For <hi>Shecinah</hi> (i.e. the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſence, or Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of God) dwelled not in Iſrael, till they had done the work (as it is written <hi>Exod.</hi> 39.43.) When the Faith of Gods Church worketh by love, and manifeſts it ſelf unto the world, God is now at liberty to ſhew, and manifeſt himſelfe from heaven to be theirs, by mercies poured out
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18542:84"/>in abundance upon them, and by doing the greateſt thing for them. And this for the fourth and laſt reaſon of the point.</p>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18542:84"/>gracious, and ſoule-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing diſpoſition in God, wherein he inclines to that poore creature of his called <hi>Man;</hi> which wrought mightily in him in that day, wherein he raiſed up the Tabernacle of <hi>Adam</hi> that was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and lifted up the heads of many thouſand generations of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity from the gates of death. The fountain and ſpring-head of this rich intereſt, and bleſſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety the Church hath in God, can be no other but ſuch a nature or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition as this, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ruling and triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him.</p>
               <p>Who would have ſaid
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18542:85"/>that ever that roote of bitterneſſe ſhould have been healed? that ſuch a prey ſhould have been taken away from the mighty? that the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the world ſhould be turned againe? that <hi>Adam</hi> with his poore, blinde, naked, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable children, after ſuch a grievous fall, and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full elongation from God thereby, ſhould ever have ſeen dayes of immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and have been made company for the Angels, and worne Crownes of righteouſneſſe and glory in the heavens?</p>
               <p>Yes: Hee that had knowne, or poſſibly could have ſeen the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18542:85"/>enlargements of the ſoule of the Almighty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man, that could have meaſured the height and depth, the length and bredth of that love of God towards him, hee might have prophecied of, and foretold theſe great wonders: In the face of this affection of his there ſhined a light, by which the bleſſed hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of mans exaltation might have been read, before any thing tending thereunto had been out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly acted or done.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, if it had been poſſible for a creature to have compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all other things in God, or ſhould God
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18542:86"/>have laid himſelfe as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and naked before his creature as all things are to him, hiding only from him this affection to man (we ſpeake of) together with the ſecret of his purpoſe for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the thing; yea, ſhould Man, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell have added to this knowledge of God, the perfect knowledge of all things whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, of all myſteries, of all ſecrets either in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or in earth, or under the earth, it would have been impoſſible that by all the ſtrength of this knowledge, the leaſt or feebleſt thought ſhould ever have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18542:86"/>for the raiſing up of fleſh and blood from that great death, under which it was ſo hopeleſly fallen. This had ſtill been a darkneſſe which all other light in the world would never have comprehended.</p>
               <p>It was more eaſie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of the power of God to have ſaid that <hi>Sarah</hi> in her old dayes ſhould give ſuck, then without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the unconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble love of God towards man, to have ſaid that man being once fallen, ſhould ever have recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any favour or intereſt in God more; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as in <hi>Sarahs</hi> being
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18542:87"/>brought back again from the unfruitfulneſſe and uncomfortableneſſe of old age to the priviledge and ſolace of youth (as the ſunne in the Dyall of <hi>Ahaz</hi>) being made a nurſe, the inviſible pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God was made viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: ſo in this intereſt and propriety which now the Church and People of God have in God, that far more exceeding abundant love of God towards man is brought forth into a perfect light, and the whole world fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the glory of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from this <hi>propriety</hi> of the Church <hi>in God,</hi> we may likewiſe obſerve by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18542:87"/>a further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation then yet happily we have attained, in that, which (I ſuppoſe) wee have often heard of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature and property of good, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing communicative, or diſpenſive of it ſelfe. The natures and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of things for the moſt part are moſt willingly learned from thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that are faireſt and perfecteſt in their kinde. We love generally (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be our prudence or pride) to be taught by great Maſters. He that deſires to underſtand the properties and qualities of light, will rather goe to the great fountaine,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18542:88"/>and informe himſelfe from the Sun, and the full ſtreames of light iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that, then to Wax Tapers or Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or other inferiour Luminaries that give out their light by meaſure, and with more malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy.</p>
               <p>To know how the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and greatneſſe of the world taſtes and relliſhes in the heart and ſoule of a man, what content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they bring with them, the greateſt Prince, or Monarch in the world is the only Oracle to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with: Men of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour place or ſtanding on earth can certifie but in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18542:88"/>part, and give but a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and imperfect an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to him that ſhould aske the queſtion, in compariſon of the other. If a man would know among thoſe that have ſuffered, how ſore and terrible the avenging wrath of God for ſin is, if it were lawfull to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and he had a minde to tell the truth, there were none to him to give information thereof. So to gaine a perfect underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding and knowledge what the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, law, motion, influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp;c. of good and goodneſſe are, there is no ſuch opportunity as to looke ſtedfaſtly upon
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18542:89"/>the glorious God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when he goeth forth in the wayes of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto the world. The lineaments, beauty, and proportion of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are no where to be ſeen ſo clearely and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, or upon tearmes of like advantage as in the face of his goodneſſe, becauſe he is both the Fountaine, and Sea of goodneſſe; yea, the Truth it ſelfe ſaith, that <hi>there is none good but one,</hi> and <hi>this one, is God.</hi> Mat. 19.17. None good <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally,</hi> and from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but God: none good, <hi>entirely,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome touch of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, but God: none
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18542:89"/>good <hi>comparatively,</hi> with a full, perfect, inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible, unwearied good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but God.</p>
               <p>Now in the Doctrine delivered, this property of goodneſſe we ſpeake of (which we may call ſelf-communication) is gloriouſly manifeſted, and that from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſubject of it in heaven and in earth; yea, from him to whom goodneſſe is eſſentiall, yea, eſſence it ſelfe. His goodneſſe ſerveth him as <hi>Davids zeale</hi> to his houſe dealt by him; <hi>It even conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, and eate him up,</hi> it left no <hi>David</hi> for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to care for, or regard: ſo the exceeding good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18542:90"/>of the moſt high God hath given away and beſtowed him with all his Greatneſſe, Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and Power, upon his poore creature: he hath made away him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from himſelfe, as far as his power was to make the alienation: he cannot indeed deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. But his goodneſſe (it ſeemes) hath tempted him to make a faire attempt to doe it. It is the excellent preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his infinite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible beeing, to doe with himſelfe what he will, what he can to the uttermoſt, to give, beſtow, alienate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18542:90"/>himſelfe, &amp;c. and yet to be never the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off from the entire and full poſſeſſion of the enjoyment of himſelfe, but rather to enjoy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage at the greateſt diſtance.</p>
               <p>So is it the native and genuine property of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted goodneſſe to quit and leave the Center, to walk the circumference: to forget one, that it may remember many: to be thrifty and ſparing at home, that it may be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall and magnificent abroad: And the reward of this goodneſſe is, the further it iſſueth and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth abroad from home,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18542:91"/>the richer laden it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth, and maketh the greateſt earnings of its owne expences. That greatneſſe which water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, which refreſheth not its owne roote by watering of others, that ſeeketh not its mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, enlargement, and exaltation by the lifting up others from the duſt, will ſoone vaniſh like a pillar of ſmoke, the roote of it will ſoone be rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the bloſſome thereof riſe up as the duſt. There is nothing good, but that for which ſomething is the better.</p>
               <p>Obſerve thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> from the truth delivered, how, and by what meanes,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18542:91"/>and from whence the Church and Children of God come to be ſo rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed, ſo gloriouſly provided above the reſt of the world, with thoſe precious habiliaments, and ornaments of grace; how they come to ſhine like Stars in the world in <hi>Knowledge, Faith, Love, Patience, Humility, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Temperance, Zeale, &amp;c.</hi> whereas other men made of the ſame fleſh and blood with them, are but as dull, dusky, and ſlimy clods of earth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither ray of this beauty, nor beame of this brightneſſe found in them. The Ground and Reaſon of the difference
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:18542:92"/>is to be ſeen face to face in the Doctrine.</p>
               <p>The men ſo far exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above their fellowes have a ſpeciall relation to, and <hi>peculiar intereſt</hi> in God. And is it then any marvell if they be not like unto other men, if the wealth and ſtate, and magnificence of heaven be found upon them, if they be arrayed in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe like the Angels of God? We uſe to ſay there is no fiſhing to fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Sea; no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the ſervice of a King: and may we not adde, no intereſt to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God? Can any man thinke that God, who is that great King:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18542:92"/>
                  <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14. in his greateſt love and deareſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhould ſuffer his ſons and daughters to be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with rags, to walke up and downe the world with their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſeen, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the children of the devill, whoſe eſtate is broken and ſunke as low as the bottome of hell, neither is able to give any other clothing, or cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his brood, but that of ſhame and confuſion of face. The Kings daughter (ſaith <hi>David) Pſal.</hi> 45.13. is glorious within, her clothing is of wrought Gold: Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the richneſſe of her attire being not only
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18542:93"/>of Gold (which is the richeſt of Metals) but of Gold improved, and which hath further coſt beſtowed upon it by the working, is but ſutable to the ſtate and condition of her Father, being a King.</p>
               <p>In former times there was a rate of coſtlineſſe in garments allowed in Kings children, which (it ſeemes) was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted others of inferiour Parentage (at leaſt not practiſed) 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.18. Ignorant and carnall men whoſe thoughts inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle not with this deare and deep intereſt the Saints have in God, are ready and apt to take
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18542:93"/>offence at their ſingular <hi>Holineſſe, Zeale,</hi> exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiteneſſe of life and waies above other men, and to thinke they doe but artificially counterfait, and diſſemble by rule, and hold (as it were) cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, that he might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with theſe ſhewes and ſemblances, and appearances of great things; and that there is no truth nor ſubſtance in them; as we reade <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.37. that the <hi>Iewes</hi> not knowing Chriſt to be the perſon he was, to have the relation unto God of a naturall Son, but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing he had Father and Mother amongſt them,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18542:94"/>of as meane and ordinary ranke as moſt of them had, were offended at him, in reſpect of that wiſdome, and thoſe mighty workes that put forth themſelves in him: they could not tell how he ſhould come honeſtly by either: it is like they thought he might deale with the devill, and have theſe rare commodities from him.</p>
               <p>So many in the world being ſtrangers to thoſe termes which ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the God of the whole earth, and thoſe that are in Covenant with him, and knowing nothing more by ſuch (in ſuch a way) then by
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18542:94"/>themſelves and others, when they ſee any thing greater and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent (at leaſt that ſeemes ſuch) in theſe men then in others, or themſelves, they cannot tell how they ſhould come by it in an ordinary and lawful way: and ſo the devill being nearer at hand to them then God, he bids them challenge him for the Author thereof; bids them ſay, it is he that teacheth and enableth them to diſſemble ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And they like obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient children, conforme themſelves: whereby it comes to paſſe that the heavenly graces of the Saints which come down
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18542:95"/>
                  <hi>from above, from God the Father of Lights</hi> (as S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh) are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, and charged to be from beneath, and to come from the devill, the father of the darkneſſe of this world. Men in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes of this nature, had rather venture the falling into a deſperate error that makes for them, then turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a little about to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the face of a truth that is bent againſt them.</p>
               <p>When we ſee a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man richer then ordinary in Jewels, Habit, and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, if ſhe be knowne to be the wife or daughter of ſome Nobleman, who
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18542:95"/>is both nobly minded, and by reaſon of the vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his eſtate, is as able to furniſh them with the richeſt Jewels, as an ordinary man his wife with Pins and lighter or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, we never ſo much as once queſtion, whether the Diamonds ſhe weares be Briſtoll ſtones or no, or whether any thing be counterfait, or baſe about her: The knowledge of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe every wayes, both for eſtate and ſpirit, to whom this woman ſtands in ſo neare a relation, ſtops the way againſt all ſuch reaſonings as theſe, and over-rules our thoughts. So if men
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18542:96"/>firſt knew the unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble riches of God, and of what ſpirit he is this way, together with the mightineſſe of his power to give ſpirituall treaſure, as Grace, Holineſſe, Zeal, &amp;c. in greateſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: and ſecondly, how neare the relation is betwixt him and his Church and People, they could not (lightly) ſo much as in all their thoughts blaſpheme their Graces, or once ſuſpect or imagine that any thing that is found upon them in that kinde, that carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the appearance of glory and excellency in it, but that it hath the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, truth, weight, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18542:96"/>ſubſtance alſo. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of the Saints hath no enemy but either he that is ignorant of their intereſt in God, or elſe of that God in whom their intereſt is.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> you may ſee (in the Doctrine deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that faire Fountaine opened that hath ſent forth (and ſtill ſendeth) all thoſe ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſtreames wherewith the City of God hath been refreſhed and made glad in all ages, I meane all thoſe mercies, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, thoſe great and ſtrange delivera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces which have been brought about for them, wherein they have been bleſſed above
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18542:97"/>other men. That inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt they had in God hath ſtood them in this ſtead, this hath been as a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of living waters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, ſpringing up continually to relieve them. The Lord (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 126.) hath done great things for us, whereof we rejoyce.</p>
               <p>What is the reaſon of that great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Church of God, and all other ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and Monarchies, and Nations of the world, which <hi>David</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.8. They are brought downe and fallen; but we are riſen and ſtand upright: that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18542:97"/>ſo many great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Nations that had Chariots, and Horſes, and walled Cities, and the thickeſt ſhields every wayes that could be made of fleſh, for their ſafety, and yet theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: we that are but a few, weake, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, (in compariſon) and yet we ſtand? The reaſon of this difference may well be gathered out of the former verſe. They truſted in Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, and Horſes; theſe were their owne, they had propriety in theſe, and ſo had the help they could afford. But the Church having the name of the God of <hi>Iacob</hi> for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18542:98"/>them, this was more for their ſecurity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, then all the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots and Horſes of war, then all Caſtles and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes whatſoever. The one had intereſt in the Lord, God was <hi>theirs,</hi> his <hi>Power,</hi> his <hi>Might,</hi> his <hi>Wiſdome</hi> was theirs, and he hath let them have their owne in all times of their neceſſity, and ſo they have been ſupported; whereas all the world beſides having no other ſtrength then themſelves, no better hope then what an arme of fleſh could doe for them, have not been able to ſtand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Lord had not been
<note place="margin">Pſ. 124.1.</note>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:18542:98"/>on our ſide,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) that is, had not God been ours, <hi>may Iſrael now ſay,</hi> if it had not been the <hi>Lord</hi> who was on our ſide when men roſe up againſt us: then they had ſwallowed us up quicke when their wrath was kindled againſt us, then had the Waters over-whelmed us, &amp;c. So may we ſay in this our ſolemne rejoycing and thankſgiving for that great deliverance now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred (and for many others formerly) If the Lord had not been on our ſide, when men roſe up againſt us (and went downe againſt us too) we alſo had been ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18542:99"/>up quick: and if not the waters, the flames of fire had over-whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us; but whether they be aloft, or below, God meets with them, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeakes:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 139.</note> 
                  <hi>If I climbe up into heaven, thou art there, if I goe downe into hell</hi> (whither theſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were in going) <hi>thou art there alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God hath ſet his ſeale upon this great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, with a faire and glorious impreſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would have it knowne for his, and make of it for himſelfe an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting name that ſhould not be cut off. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore woe be to him that ſhall deface this Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18542:99"/>which the Lord himſelfe hath erected in the midſt of this Nation, and hath engraven and written praiſe and glory to his owne name upon it. Woe be to him (I ſay) that ſhall let the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it periſh or fall to the ground. When mens owne tongues fall upon them, and cauſe them to fall, <hi>All men</hi> ſaith <hi>David, ſhall ſee and know it is the Lords worke.</hi> Pſal. 64.8, 9.</p>
               <p>Let me ſay one thing further to you; I would not have you only to conſider how great the deliverance is, what a glorious train of mercies and bleſſings it hath to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18542:100"/>follow it, and attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: but if I could, I would teach you an art how to fulfill your owne joy, how to make a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and treble improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this and other mercies given you. Then muſt I wiſh you not to lay out the ſtrength of your joy too freely upon your deliverance it ſelfe, or all that comes by it, (for indeed it was a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-mercy, having a thouſand more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the bowels of it, and brings forth fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to this day) but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your ſelves rather to conſider who it was that wrought it for you, it was the Lord, it was
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18542:100"/>your God. The woman of <hi>Samaria, Iohn</hi> 4.12. thought their Wel of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char</hi> had a kinde of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon it above others, becauſe ſo great a man as their Father <hi>Iacob</hi> dranke of it; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we that are the Church and People of God, may truly, and with ſoberneſſe of judgement thinke our ſelves bleſſed indeed, that we draw all the waters we drinke, all the mercies and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations we enjoy from ſuch a Fountaine, as the goodneſſe of the great God of heaven and earth. The ſame mercies and good things, did we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from another, from
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18542:101"/>an inferiour hand, were not the ſame; the beſt and pleaſanteſt taſte, and reliſh that is in them (what ever they be) is the taſte of the hand out of which they come. And therefore prophane and ignorant men loſe the beſt part of all the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall good things they enjoy, becauſe they doe not ſavour the hand that gives them forth unto them. <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi>

                  <hi>hath done great things for us; whereof we rejoyce.</hi> If <hi>David,</hi> were now alive, and the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion put to him, where the <hi>Emphaſis</hi> and life of theſe words lay; I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeve his anſwer
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18542:101"/>would be; not in the great things that were done for them, but rather in the great doer of them, the Lord. The Lord hath done, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is a rule and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in common reaſon and experience, (and weak apprehenſions will reach it) which <hi>Xenophon</hi> well expreſſeth in his language, thus: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18542:102"/>if the inequality of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from whom they come be great. To kiſſe the hand of a man inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to us is as nothing, rather indeed a diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and a thing ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous: but to kiſſe the hand of a Prince is a matter of favour and countenance. So <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of <hi>the light of the countenance,</hi> or <hi>favour of the King,</hi> that it is like <hi>a Cloud of the latter raine:</hi> which often is more worth then a Kings ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.15. whereas a good looke from a meane man is ſcarcely valued at two drops of water. God cannot give any light or
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:18542:102"/>ſlender mercies, becauſe the greatneſſe of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver makes them all weighty, and full of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>The Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God having this ſpeciall intereſt in God, which makes him <hi>theirs,</hi> if they love him, what ſingular or ſtrange thing do they?

And this <hi>Eraſmus</hi> reports, that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in his time, ſeemed to the generality of men, <hi>Partim ſtultus, partim ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> partly a foole, and partly a knave (as we uſe to ſpeake.) The ſpirituall man ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Cor. 2.15. is judged of no man, that is, is not rightly and truly judged of, by any man (but only by his owne ſociety, men that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18542:104"/>are ſpirituall like himſelf) by any certaine rule of judgement, becauſe his grounds, principles, ends, relations, &amp;c. are not knowne, believed, or comprehended by other men. But though he be judged of no man in this ſenſe, (for the reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) yet is he judged and rejudged over and over, after a faſhion, by all ſorts of men, and no man hath more verdicts and cenſures paſt upon him, then he, and theſe as wilde, and inconſiſtent with themſelves as light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can be: As it is with unskilfull Archers, that ſhoot over, and under, and on both ſides, but
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18542:105"/>never come neare the But or Marke they ſhoot at.</p>
               <p>But if men did fully apprehend and believe this ſpeciall relation of theirs we ſpeake of, this peculiar intereſt they have in God, it would neither be thought either defect in wiſdome, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of diſſimulation, that ſuch ſhould with that freeneſſe give out their ſtrength unto him, and beſtow themſelves with that which is theirs upon him, but would judge it a ſober, orderly, and well-reſolved courſe; a courſe whereunto the wiſdomes, diſcretions, and even naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18542:105"/>themſelves in other things. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> (doubtleſſe) was at great expences, and laviſht Gold apace out of the bagge (what other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences ſoever he put himſelfe upon) when he built that royall Palace of <hi>Babel:</hi> but becauſe it was his <hi>owne,</hi>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18542:106"/>how the King and his Treaſure came ſo ſoone parted? and have deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him greater in power then in wiſdome. And generally when men doe beſtow coſt upon things that be their owne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be for their credit, profit, or the like, if the ſubject upon which it is beſtowed, or laid out, as for example, Houſe, Lands, Wife, Children, or the like, will reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (or but tolerably) beare it, it is paſſed over as a matter of no great obſervation; men are not taxed with the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of any rule, or law either of honeſty or diſcretion, in ſuch a caſe.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:18542:106"/>
               <p> Behold, is he not <hi>their</hi> God? have they not a <hi>peculiar</hi> right and propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in him? He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his Wife (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.28. and may not I ſay much more, he that loveth his God?) loveth Himſelf: Yea, he that loveth his God moſt, loveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moſt; and doth it argue either want of wit, or honeſty, that men ſhould love themſelves? Or what greater honour and eſteeme, yea what greater profit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage can, in a regular way, be expected then that it ſhould be publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the world, that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18542:107"/>that God whom wee ſerve, and in whom wee have a propriety as our owne, is the only true God, a God of infinite goodneſſe, power, and majeſty? The true God is called the glory of thoſe that worſhip him. They changed their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into the ſimilitude of an Oxe that eateth graſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.20. So again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.7. As on the contrary, to be miſtaken in a mans God, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſerve, and to be coupled with a ſtrange god, with a filthy Idoll, (as the beſt of all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped gods are, the true God only excepted) is a great reproach and ſtaine
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18542:107"/>to the dignity and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of a man. They went to Baal-Peor, and ſeparated themſelves to that ſhame, &amp;c. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.10. So <hi>Ier.</hi> 11.13. You ſet up Altars to that ſhame, &amp;c. Yea, to be under queſtion or juſt ſuſpition of ſuch an error and great evill, is not a thing ſo well conſiſting with any mans reputation in the world. Now that a man hath indeed the Lord for his God (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeaketh) that he that is God indeed, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed himſelf unto him, and that the devill hath not furniſht him and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided him of a god, is a thing which cannot fully
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18542:108"/>be manifeſted by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light whatſoever, but only by pouring out our ſelves, and our whole ſubſtance freely and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly in his worſhip and ſervice. And may not thoughts of jealouſie be juſtly taken up againſt a man, that he hath ſome ignoble god for his god, that he goeth not above the Sun, Moone, and Stars, (if he goeth ſo far) to fetch the deity he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippeth, when the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice he offers is only the lame and torne of his flock; when he ſerves him with an evill eye, or thinkes any thing too good, or too great for him? <hi>Curſed be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:18542:108"/>(ſaith the Lord by his Prophet, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14.) <hi>which hath in his flocke a Male, and voweth and ſacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing.</hi> But why ſhould ſuch a man be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? or how is he a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver? The Reaſon of both followeth (and is the ſame) <hi>For I am a great King, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Implying, that he that worſhippeth or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth God, in a low, ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, looſe, and perfuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner, is an enemy to his greatneſſe, and glory of his Majeſty, and goeth about (as it were) to perſwade the world, that God is not the God which indeed he is, ſo
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18542:109"/>great and terrible: and ſo deceiveth it. This for the fifth branch of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, this Hony-Combe will yet drop once more. This peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar intereſt of the Church in God, is a ſure ground of a moſt certaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible preſage, what will be the end of all the enemies thereof, and what the iſſue of all the attempts of thoſe that ſhall ſeeke to doe it evill. Fruſtration will (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly) be the end of all ſuch attempts, and confuſion the end of all their enemies. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and people of God have been, yet are, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18542:109"/>ſtill will be too hard for all the world to deale with: there is no med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them but only in a way of love and kindneſſe: and ſo they are the profitableſt men under heaven to converſe and deale withall. He that is the Sanctuary, will be a ſtumbling ſtone, and as a Rock to fall upon, and as a ſnare to all the Inhabitants of the earth, that ſhall either lift up a tongue, or ſtretch forth a hand againſt them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 8.14.</p>
               <p>It is true, The People of God ſeem to be of all men <hi>Opportuni injuriis,</hi> (as he ſaid) <hi>Men,</hi> that if any man had a minde to doe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18542:110"/>miſchiefe good cheape, were for his turne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their arme of fleſh (for the moſt part) is but weake and contemptible: Neither doth the world love them ſo well as to provide them any guard of their ſtrength to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them. But they have one alwaies ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by them, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a man of Warre, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.3. But ſhewes not himſelfe, appeares not till the day of Battell: but then he breakes out like a Lion out of the thicket, (as the Prophet ſpeakes) and teares all in pieces, and devours.

               <head>CAP. VI. <hi>Wherein the Doctrine is further drawne out in an uſe of Encouragement, or</hi> Conſolation.</head>
               <p>SEcondly, the Doctrine propounded, affords matter of comfort and encouragement (&amp; thoſe of the fulleſt and largeſt proportions) to the Church of God, and thoſe that are members thereof. If God be yours (you, Church and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God) if you have this ſpeciall intereſt in him, then up with thoſe hands that hang downe, and let thoſe knees that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:18542:111"/>are feeble take ſtrength to themſelves, and thoſe hearts that are ſmitten within you, and wither like the graſſe, let them flouriſh againe like the green herb. If God be yours, why do you feare, or why do you take care, who, or how many they be that are againſt you? Will you prophane the Sanctuary of your ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth by your feares, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute that bleſſed Name that is called upon you, and by you? Will you unſanctifie the holy One? Will you proclaime it in the hearing of the world? ſhall <hi>Gath</hi> and <hi>Aſhkelon</hi> have information from you, that his arme is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:18542:111"/>ſhortened? that he is now become as man, and no longer a God? that his horſe are fleſh, and not ſpirit? What do you elſe (my Brethren) that caſt away your hope and confidence, (which your enemies gather up, as faſt as they perceive you to ſcatter, and make hope and confidence of it for themſelves) and give the cauſe and ſtate of the Church of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion amongſt you as good as loſt, which is yet more worth then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worlds? <hi>Sampſons</hi> courage was above his ſtrength, (<hi>Iudg.</hi> 16.20.) becauſe (ſaith the Text) <hi>He knew not that the Lord
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:18542:112"/>was departed from him:</hi> and therefore when he went forth, thinking to doe as he did at other times, he was taken of his enemies. But your ſtrength is a great deale more then your courage, becauſe God is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from you: Nay, he hath bound himſelfe unto you (whileſt you continue his Church and People) with bands which he cannot breake. It is like you will ſay; Ah! but we cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne any ſignes of his preſence: if God be with us, or on our ſide, why is it thus?</p>
               <p>Let me reaſon a few things with you, to allay
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:18542:112"/>the bitterneſſe of theſe complaints and feares. Doe yee thinke, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (in good earneſt) that you are now in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter danger, nearer ruine and deſtruction then you were at that time, when he that is your God ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in between the Match and the Powder, and kept them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the one at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Only now (it may be) you ſee and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend more: but the danger is not the greater, but the leſſer by that. When the Diſciples, not long after the Miracle of the Loaves, began to queſtion their proviſion of Victualls, how ſharply
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18542:113"/>doth our Saviour rebuke them, as fooles, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding, Mar. 8.17, 18. <hi>Why reaſon ye thus, becauſe ye have no Bread? perceive ye not yet, neither underſtand? have ye your heart yet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened? having eyes, ſee you not? and having eares, heare you not? and doe ye not remember? When I brake the five Loaves among five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, how many Baskets full of fragments tooke you up? They ſaid unto him, Twelve. And when the ſeven among foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, how many Baskets full of fragments tooke yee up? And they ſaid, Seven. And he ſaid unto them,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18542:113"/>how is it, that ye doe not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if he ſhould ſay, it is the moſt unworthy and unſavoury thought and conceit in the world to lodge in you, who have ſo lately, and that againe and againe, and ſo apparently ſeene, and had experience, both of the tenderneſſe of my care, and mightineſſe of my power in making proviſion of Bread for you, to ſuſpect or feare inconvenience that way, that ever you ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer hunger or be affami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Have we not had as cleare, as mighty a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance we now cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18542:114"/>(with many other) of the care, providence, and protection of God over us, for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our lives, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, goods, Religion? and ſhall we ſuffer ſuch an unworthy and ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious apprehenſion to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over us as this, that God will now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us up to the will of our enemies, becauſe his time and our time for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, are not yet met? our time for eaſe, comfort, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, being alwaies; but Gods time, many times, not yet. Let me ask you, how many barrels of Gunpowder tooke ye up out of the Vault? how
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18542:114"/>many barres of Iron, and Billets, and Faggots took ye up? how many Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors hanged ye up? Doe ye not yet perceive, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtand, what all this meaneth?</p>
               <p>Again, in Eighty eight, how many Ships did ye batter, ſpoile, and ſinke? how many did you take for your ſelfe? how plentifull and royall a feaſt did you prepare for the fiſh of the Sea with the fleſh of your enemies, and the blood of the mighty? <hi>David</hi> hath ſuch an expreſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Providence of God towards his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the deſtruction of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as this, Pſ. 74.14.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18542:115"/>
                  <hi>Thou brakeſt the head of Leviathan in pieces: and gaveſt him to be meate for the people in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.</hi> He calls the proud, cruell, inſulting King, by the name of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan,</hi> (i. e. the great Whale, <hi>Iob</hi> 41.1.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to change his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and take the Seas, and meant to deſtroy and devoure there, as well as he did on the Land. <hi>Thou brakeſt his head in pieces,</hi> i. e. thou utterly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt him, lefteſt nothing of him remaining; there was not one Aegyptian left (ſaith the Scripture) that accompanied <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> in that bloody Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:18542:115"/>
                  <hi>Thou gaveſt him to be meate for the people in the Wilderneſſe.</hi> What is this? I conceive this to be the meaning. The People when they came into the Wilderneſſe, and ſaw ſmall or no meanes to ſupport them, ſaw no table, no proviſion, &amp;c. might be tempted to doubt of, or to diſtruſt the providence of God towards them. But God (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) had given them <hi>Leviathan</hi> for meat: that is, that great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw that was given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull deliverance which God wrought for his people thereby, was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to uphold their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18542:116"/>ſpirits, and maintaine a life of hope and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence within them, that God that had done ſuch great things for them, would never ſuffer them to periſh by forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the arme of his preſervation and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from them, if they would but looke up unto him, and make their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the glorious encouragement and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing provocation of ſo great and unheard of a deliverance.</p>
               <p>So, ſuppoſe we be now in the Wilderneſſe, we ſee no meanes of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, of ſubſiſting before
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:18542:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>us, we have not thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, thoſe ſenſible teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Gods preſence with us, as ſometimes we have had, yet God hath given us meat, to feed and live upon: thoſe 36. Barrells of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, wherewith God furniſhed us out of the Cellar at our enemies coſt, let us drinke downe them, they will breed good blood, ſpirit, and courage: againe, thoſe Iron barres, and billets of the ſame gracious and miraculous proviſion, let us feed upon them, and digeſt them by a mature and kinde concoction; I make no queſtion but we ſhall renew our ſtrength
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18542:117"/>like Eagles, and be yong and luſty againe in our Faith towards God.</p>
               <p>When the Iſraelites afterwards, <hi>ſo oft prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God in the Wilderneſſe,</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.40.) <hi>and grieved him in the Deſart, viz.</hi> by murmuring, and diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, <hi>When they tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, and limited the holy One of Iſrael:</hi> hee imputeth all this ſin of theirs to this, as the cauſe, <hi>They remembred not his hand, nor the day wherein he delivered them from the enemy:</hi> they forſook the meate God had given them, they gave over feeding on <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and ſo they fainted, their
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18542:117"/>Faith was affamiſhed, and themſelves periſhed. Therfore let us preſerve the memoriall of this great delivera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious treaſure by us: Let us ſeaſon the fleſh of the Traitors the Gunpowder, the Barre, the Billets, that they may keep freſh and ſweet; and ſo doubtleſſe they will be a nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an high and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſpirit, both for us and our poſterities to feed upon, and to preſerve the life of the peace, and ſafety of the Nation, as long as Sun and Moone ſhall endure.</p>
               <p>Such a Preſervation, ſuch a Deliverance as this, ſo deep and downe
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18542:118"/>laden (as it were) with the precious ſpoiles of heaven, the ingredients and ſubſtance of it being nothing elſe but the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, incomprehenſible wiſdome, power, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, love, and mercy of God, is enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich a Nation alone, and to fill the hearts of all the Inhabitants thereof with the entireneſſe &amp; ſtrength of Faith, and dependance upon God, which are able to laugh all future enemies, dangers, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts in the face to ſcorne. This for the third uſe of the Doctrine, by way of encouragement, or conſolation.</p>

               <head>CAP. VII. <hi>Wherein the two firſt branches of the third</hi> Uſe <hi>(being an uſe of</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe) <hi>are handled.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the third place, the Doctrine firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, is further ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable unto us by way of Reproofe. For if the Church and Children of God have that deep and deare intereſt in God, which hath been opened unto you; how ſhall thoſe be excuſed or ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from paſſing under the rod of Reproofe, who taking this great honour to themſelves, of being
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18542:119"/>the Church of God, and People of God, (whether truly or falſely, whether they be his People or no) and yet doe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the tenour of ſuch an intereſt, and by many miſdemeanours and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy cariages of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, deface the glory of ſo high a prerogative, that in word profeſſe an intereſt in God, but in workes and deeds (which are witneſſes of greater value) deny it.</p>
               <p>Now three things there are (more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) whereby men wave all intereſt in God, and doe little leſſe then make open confeſſion in the world againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18542:119"/>that they are not the men in heart that they are in the face.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in a baſe creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or crouching before the world, and ſeeking the face of the creature, in inordinate deſires after outward things, and not being richlyſatisfied with God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in making dependance upon an arm of fleſh, and upon the creatures, and not upon God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, in inordinate feares of thoſe that are enemies, and riſe up againſt them, and not making God their only feare and dread.</p>
               <p>In theſe particulars
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18542:120"/>(eſpecially) amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, men often offend (and that greatly) againſt ſuch intereſt as they have in God: ſuch carriages as theſe being interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are as much as to ſay, Such men confeſſe that they have no portion nor intereſt in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when men in an unſeemly manner are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious in doing ſuit and ſervice to the world, when they ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo farre to bee brought into ſubjection by Silver, and Gold, and Houſes, and Lands, by faire and full Eſtates, by Pleaſures, and Eaſe, and Liberty, &amp;c. that a man (in Scripture phraſe) is
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18542:120"/>not able to live without theſe, yea, and to raigne too, (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes) to live like Kings without theſe: this is a betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe which is annexed to that intereſt, which any creature hath in God. Are there not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that would bee thought people of God, and to have intereſt in him, that yet are as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and impotent in their deſires and luſtings after things of this life, as <hi>Rachel</hi> was after Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Give me Children, or elſe I die?</hi> Gen. 30.1. So many muſt have the flowre of the Wheate, and Honey out of the

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (as he ſaid) <hi>Their life is not worth the living,</hi> their hearts die and ſink within them, and they are <hi>Like to thoſe that goe downe into the Pit,</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks) and what can be more prejudiciall to the glory of God? what can dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate more from his goodnes, bounty, &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then to finde men in theſe deep diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in ſuch faintings of heart for want of theſe by-matters of the world, who pretend and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge <hi>intereſt in God,</hi> and his All-ſufficiency?</p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:18542:121"/>
               <p> Doth not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prove the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the dead? and that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> are yet living, by this argument, that God is the God not of the dead, but of the living.</p>
               <p>The force and ſtrength of the Argument and Reaſon (I conceive) lieth in this. That God being a God of that infinite <hi>goodneſſe</hi> and <hi>bounty,</hi> and withall of <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>greatneſſe</hi> anſwerable, it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a thing unworthy of him, to call himſelfe the God of ſuch, or to aſcribe that ſpeciall and peculiar intereſt of himſelfe to ſuch creatures as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18542:122"/>and deſtitute of the beſt of their <hi>beeing,</hi> their life; he ſhall lay his owne honour in the duſt to doe it. What diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſhall there be then between an infinite God, and the moſt contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of creatures, in this reſpect, if a man might have God for his God, have the beſt intereſt in him, and yet be as low, and as little worth as he could be, had he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the pooreſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the world? (For what condition more empty and poore then death?)</p>
               <p>So (my brethren) they that call themſelves by the names of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18542:122"/>or People, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend or challenge intereſt in God, and yet hang downe their heads like Bull-ruſhes in every Storme, and are as dead men, without any life or ſoule of joy or comfort, except the world puts life into them, doe not theſe make God to bee the God of the dead, and not only of the living? by valuing their intereſt in God at ſo meane a rate, as not to make it a ſufficient ground of joy and comfort unto them in the abſence of Moone and Stars; as if there were no efficacy and power in it, to raiſe the ſoule of a man, but only
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18542:123"/>in conjunction with <hi>Corn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 4.</note> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>Oyle;</hi> doe you not ſpread a Cloud before the glorious face of the Al-ſufficiency of God, and take a courſe to bring up an evill and hard report in the world of him, and his goodneſſe, and weaken and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the hearts of men for ever chuſing God for their portion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elkanah</hi> did well and truly repreſent the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able temper of his wife for want of Children,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.10.</note> as reflecting ſome prejudice and diſparagement upon him, being her husband: <hi>Hanna, why weepeſt thou? Am not I better unto thee
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:18542:123"/>then ten Sons?</hi> q. d. if thou kneweſt and didſt but conſider what cauſe thou haſt of comfort and joy in me, and my love and affection towards thee, thou wouldeſt not be ſo diſquieted and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for want of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; is not the intereſt thou haſt in me, valuable with the comfort and contentment of many Children?</p>
               <p>So if we ſhall ſay wee have intereſt in God, and yet walke with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected countenances, and with hands hanging down, becauſe <hi>The Figge trees doe not flouriſh,</hi> and becauſe <hi>There is no fruit on the Vine,</hi> and the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18542:124"/>
                  <hi>Fields yeeld no meate,</hi> (as it is <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17.) becauſe outward comforts faile and are cut off from us, doe we not darken the face of the heaven, and ſhame the glory of the infinite goodneſſe and greatneſſe of God? is not God unto us more then many Houſes, and Lands, then Silver and Gold? as we are unto him of more worth and value then many Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; ſo is not he more to us then many worlds?</p>
               <p>Therefore now let him that claimeth inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God, that ſaith God is his God, let him vindicate and make good ſo great a title and claime
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:18542:124"/>in the ſight of the world, by a heart full of joy, and full of contentment in the midſt of outward wants, and neceſſities, of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nakedneſſe, reproach, &amp;c. If he hath an eſtate of joy and peace in God, it is an unſeemly thing for him to fill the eares of the world, or to breake the hearts of men with complaints of wants and miſery. He that hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, muſt bee able to work wonders in the world, or elſe he ſhall ſhame his glory, and the world will not believe him. As our Saviour ſaid of thoſe that ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that thoſe ſignes ſhould follow them,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18542:125"/>
                  <hi>Marke</hi> 16.17. <hi>In his name they ſhould caſt out devils, and they ſhall ſpeake with new tongues, and they ſhall take away Serpents, and if they ſhall drinke any dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, it ſhall not hurt them.</hi> So (my brethren) they that ſay (with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>) that God is their God, that they have an intereſt in him, ſuch ſignes as theſe muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>low them as a glorious retinue in the world, to anſwer that greatneſſe: they muſt be rich with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an eſtate, joyfull in the midſt of ſorrow, ſtrong in weakneſſe, they muſt not burne in midſt of fire, nor drowne in overflowing of darkeſt
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18542:125"/>waters, they muſt live without a ſoule, and ſleep without a bed, and be clothed without rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be at liberty in priſon, in their native countrey when they are in exile, and baniſhment; in a word (as S. <hi>Pauls</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is) though <hi>they have nothing,</hi> yet muſt they be <hi>as though they had all things:</hi> otherwiſe they are, as if they had no intereſt in God at all. If God be thine, and yet thou ſayeſt thou wanteſt any thing, <hi>thou art a lyar,</hi> (as <hi>Iohn</hi> in another caſe ſaith) <hi>and the truth is not in thee.</hi> For (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.) <hi>Of them that feare the Lord,</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:18542:126"/>we may as well, with as much truth, (and with more perſpicuity and evidence of truth) they that injoy the Lord, <hi>and have intereſt in him,</hi> want nothing: (except perhaps the knowledge of their abundance) God will fill any mans cup alone, and make it overflow and run over, though there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it beſides.</p>
               <p>And this reproofe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes us, not only as we are private Chriſtians, and every man one by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but as we are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a People of God, a Church of God. If we have intereſt in God, (as we pretend we have, in calling our ſelves the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18542:126"/>Church and People of God, as you have heard) then are we not to bow downe our backs, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all kinde of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to goe over us (as generally we doe) and to tread downe the ſtrength and comfort of our hearts, becauſe the world refuſeth to give us the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, becauſe they that are mounted upon the high places of the earth (as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeakes) <hi>Behold us afar off, and doe not favour our righteous dealings, nor countenance us in our wayes.</hi> Is not our God unto us above all gods? (as <hi>Davids</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:18542:127"/>expreſſion is) what if the faces of Rulers ſhould be clouded, ſhould we not rejoyce nevertheleſſe, if the light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhine upon us? Shall we complaine that the <hi>Moone</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> doe not appeare and ſhine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, when the <hi>Sunne</hi> ſhines out unto us in the fulneſſe of his ſtrength? were not this to caſt an aſperſion upon that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious creature the <hi>Sunne,</hi> the beauty of heaven, as if he wanted the help of inferiour Luminaries to ſerve the world with that great and heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of light? And ſhall we not charge weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and inſufficiency
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18542:127"/>upon the great God of heaven and earth, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and cheriſh us, if we be therefore ſad and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, becauſe we have not alike intereſt in thoſe gods, that are made of men, I meane <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> of the earth, as well as <hi>in Him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Synagogue of <hi>Rome</hi> commends her ſelfe to the world for the Church of God: yea, ſhe muſt be it and no other, and challengeth deep intereſt in God. And intereſt I beleeve ſhe hath enough in the god of this world, hee eſpied out for her, and provided the beſt Vault
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18542:128"/>he could finde in all his kingdome of darkneſſe, for advancement of her deſignes, he furniſhed her with engines and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, ſuch as his kingdome affords, to have given that fatall and terrible blow (as they called it) to their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, but that this ſame heaven is above him, and is too hard for him, and troubles him, and will not condeſcend to the deſignes of hell, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing to proſper wherein he deſires to pleaſure them. So that I ſay, in this god of theirs (doubtleſſe) they have intereſt to their hearts deſire. But if they have
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18542:128"/>intereſt in that God which is holy and al-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient (as the world muſt beleeve, or ſtand ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged as hereticall in that point) why are they ſo diſcontented with their portion, as to digge into hell to finde a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of blood, to mend their cup withall? why could they not let this poore ſhovell-full of earth, caſt up in the midſt of the Sea, (as one of their Spaniſh Kings, if my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance faileth mee not, in the height of his malice and ſwelling vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty termed this <hi>Iſland</hi> of ours) why did they not let it alone? If their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be in heaven (as they
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18542:129"/>ſay) a ſhovell full of earth would have been but a mean and unworthy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to it. Alas, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable hungring and thirſting after blood, and that hunting the lives of thoſe that they judge their enemies, thoſe ſixe and thirty <hi>Barrels of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder,</hi> with thoſe <hi>Barres of Iron,</hi> and <hi>Billets of wood,</hi> (which may bee quartered for the armes <hi>of the Babyloniſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi>) theſe, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other like baſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, of drawing in the world into them, and all they can lay hold of, and faſten their talons on upon earth, theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime to the world, that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18542:129"/>they are altogether diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and diſtruſt that title and claime they lay, to be the Church of God: It is a plain ſigne againſt them that they looke for little from heaven. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>Saul,</hi> when God had forſaken him, and would not anſwer him, <hi>went for counſell to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill;</hi> So doe theſe men (if they did but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the voice and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of their own waies and workes) make a plain confeſſion to the world, that God hath forſaken them; and therefore ſince they are deſperate of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their deſires out of heaven, they will worke it out of Hell,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:18542:130"/>if it bee to bee had there.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thoſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſin againſt this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God (and are to be reproved) that make their dependance upon any creature, that make fleſh their arme: (as <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.5.) this ſin is of ſome affinity with the former: But as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> were <hi>brethren in iniquity,</hi> and ſinned together, ſo muſt they be rebuked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved together by their Father. Many will ſay of God, that he is their God, and challenge inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in him, that yet doe not ſpeak unto him from their hearts, and ſay unto him, as <hi>David</hi> often did, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.3.) <hi>Thou art my
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18542:130"/>Rock, and my Fortreſſe,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.31. <hi>Who is a Rock, ſave our God?</hi> Men will have other Rocks to build the houſe of their defence upon, and their hope upon: men are afraid to adventure the weight of all their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, of all they have, and of all they hope, and of all they deſire, upon God alone, except they have ſome other foundation that they may ſee and looke upon, to lay with him. As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (<hi>Exod.</hi> 32.1.) muſt have gods made them, <hi>that might goe before them,</hi> that <hi>they might ſee them,</hi> and look upon them, becauſe that they had not <hi>Moſes</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:18542:131"/>to looke upon, he was out of ſight, they knew not what was become of him: <hi>Vp, make us gods to goe before us,</hi> (ſay they to <hi>Aaron.</hi>)</p>
               <p>So (my Brethren) moſt men muſt have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of God to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, i. e. ſomething upon which they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truſt to, and caſt all the weight and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of their cares and feares upon, that they may converſe with by ſome outward ſenſe or other, chiefly by the eye, they muſt ſee him: As for the inviſible God, of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (as it is ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. that <hi>He ſaw him
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18542:131"/>that was inviſible</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is ſtill out of ſight, they know not where he is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have no minde to depend upon him, no more then the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he was but a while ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>If we could looke into men, and ſee into the depth of their thoughts, wee ſhould finde the hearts of moſt bottomed with creatures, as with Silver and Gold, Eſtate, Greatneſſe, Favour, or Credit in the world, a very ſmall remnent with the living God: And therefore we ſee when any of their bottomes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18542:132"/>or are knockt out, all mens hopes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and expectations run out, and are like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpilt upon the ground that cannot be gathered up againe: whereas if mens dependance were upon God, if the weight of all their hopes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires reſted and ſtaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, though all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward props and ſupports were ſtruck from under them, yet a man ſhould be able to keep his ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not fall to the ground, becauſe God is a <hi>Rock,</hi> and a <hi>Rock</hi> alwayes keepes his place, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gives way; if you know where it is to day, you know where it
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18542:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>will be to morrow.</p>
               <p>Now this is that I ſay, that if a man claimes that ſpeciall intereſt in God, which is the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Children, and yet makes his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon any thing beſides whatſoever: as the <hi>Maid</hi> ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>his ſpeech betraid him,</hi> ſo ſuch a mans way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayeth him to be but an idle pretender to that royall priviledge, and that indeed he knows not what any ſuch intereſt meanes. Our full and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire dependance upon God, is the beſt, and higheſt, and moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable part of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; it is the Center
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18542:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>point (as it were) of our obedience, that is better then all the Circle and Circumference beſides: <hi>Obedience</hi> is better then <hi>Sacrifice</hi> (as <hi>Samuel</hi>) but <hi>dependance</hi> is better then <hi>ſacrifice</hi> and obedience (in other kindes) both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. That ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, which no perſwaſions, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, nor threatnings will prevaile with men, but that they will needs caſt it away from them as far as it will fly, as a thing that would but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe them, and doe them no good, this is that that hath the great recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18542:133"/>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35.) as if there were inferiour rewards prepared for other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, but the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the right hand and left of Chriſt in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, were reſerved for this. But if men have any thing elſe, any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that flatters them, and ſayes unto them, as the Bramble ſaid to the Trees of the Forreſt in <hi>Iothams</hi> Parable,
<note place="margin">Judg. 9.15</note> 
                  <hi>Come and put your truſt under my ſhadow,</hi> place your confidence in me; Men will hardly be intreated to caſt away ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence upon any termes.</p>
               <p>If a great eſtate, or ſome great friend that is eminent in place and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18542:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>power ſhould but allure us, and ſpeake as kindly and gratiouſly unto us, as the great God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth doth from place to place in his Word, caſt all your care, and your burden upon us, we will take care for you: Men would take hold of ſuch words, as ſoone as they ſhould be ſpoken, and would doe that which was deſired of them with all their hearts, and would hardly aske any queſtion about it, either for conſcience ſake, or for feares ſake. But now God inviting us to doe him that honour and our ſelves that eaſe, as to caſt all our care on

Even they which doe any thing in this kinde, they will not caſt their care upon him; all they will be brought to doe is, to lay it on him faire and ſoftly, as we uſe to lay burdens of any weight upon Tables or Stooles, when we ſuſpect the joynts to be crazy and ſhaken, we lay them downe as gently and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:18542:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>eaſily as may be, for feare we ſhould breake all in pieces, and our burdens fall to the ground; and as men uſe to walke upon Ice over deep Waters, they doe not at firſt leap and jump upon it, but firſt ſet one foote, and then another, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Ice crack or no, whether it will beare them, that ſo they may retire back againe to the ground without danger, before they be on too far: but to goe thus to worke with God, is not to caſt our care upon him, but rather to tempt him, and ſee whether he wil beare it or no. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he gives us in that, an

               <p>Therefore now if thou haſt intereſt in God, and haſt any burthens, one or more, to beare or

We account it a meane calling among men, and ſervile, to carry burdens, but it is exceeding glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in God, to beare all the burdens of his Saints, that they may walke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and not have their backs bowed downe to the earth.</p>

               </p>
               <p>God divides the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with his Church, he will honour himſelfe and his Church together, in the deſtruction of the world; God could have tempered another cup that ſhould have been as preſent death to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to have drunke of it, (<hi>Zach.</hi> 12.2.) but <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> muſt be made the cup of poyſon to all the people round about, when they ſhall be in the ſiege againſt Judah and Jeruſalem.

               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> indeed gapes after this priviledge, and makes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that all Nations and Churches in the world that will not bow downe and ſerve her, and fall downe and worſhip

               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it is to bee knowne likewiſe, and conſidered, that the Church is not appointed only and ſimply, to be the deſtruction of the wicked, and enemies of God, but to be their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in a ſpeciall and more remarkable way and manner, <hi>viz.</hi> in the nature of a <hi>Snare,</hi> that they may not feare, nor thinke of deſtruction from it, till it be upon them; or that kinde of deſtruction which the

Behold all they that provoke thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eſay</hi> 41.11.) <hi>ſhall be aſhamed and confounded.</hi> To be <hi>confounded</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is this; when a man hath been lifted up in great hopes, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſucceſſe, victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and prevailing in any thing, and then on a ſudden, quite beſides his expectation, is brought downe, and falls upon inevitable deſtruction, &amp; knowes not how to help himſelfe.</p>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18542:152"/>them: now poyſon we know (eſpecially in a cup) hath the nature of a ſnare in it, men that drinke it, are not aware of it; if it be artificiall and Italian right, it hath neither ſmell nor colour in it, to cauſe any feare or jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie at all in him that ſhall drinke it, it ſhall have the appearance, and ſmell, and manifeſt taſte of Wine that is made by God to ſtrengthen mans heart; (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes) and this poyſon God will put into a cup too, the Church ſhall be a cup of poyſon, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſhall be made fit to provoke the thirſt of the enemie, to draw him on to take

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:18542:153"/>there is in drinking a cup of Wine that ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
               <p>And ſo the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, of making the Church a <hi>heavy ſtone,</hi> that ſhall over-heare and teare in pieces him that ſhall offer to heave and lift it up, falls this way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18542:153"/>from place to place by an engine, a man, though of great ſtrength, will never try to lift it; not ſo much as a thought enters into him of taking it upon his ſhoulder, to ſteale and carry it away: but the heavineſſe of a ſtone is not ſo apparent, it is not knowne till a man taſte it with his arm or ſhoulder, or the like. Now the Church of God is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a great ſtone, the enemies have no great minde to be medling with it, they have no hope to heave it, there is a face of beauty, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſtrength upon it, and then they make no
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18542:154"/>great haſt to the ſpoile of it; but ſometimes again, the outward appearance and figure of this ſtone is quite changed and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it ſeems to be brought to ſo ſmall a ſize, that it may well be loaden and carried away; the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies make no queſtion but to build themſelves houſes with it; but it is now as heavy and maſſy as ever, and will be the breaking in pieces, and certaine death of who ever ſhall offer to lift it up.</p>
               <p>Fifthly therefore, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that is further to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, concerning Gods withdrawing his viſible preſence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Chruch
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18542:154"/>at any time, when their wonted tokens are not to be ſeen; I meane in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of any favour or countenance he gives his Church in the eyes of the world, to aſſiſt and ſtrengthen the hand of it, there is no great cauſe of feare for all this, as if the Church were now upon the point of periſhing, or ſinking under water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a withdrawing as this from his Church, is ſimply neceſſary for ſetting his <hi>Snare.</hi> The Church could not be a Gin to catch the enemies of it in ſuch a manner as is ſpoken of, except things were thus carried in the wiſdome and providence
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:18542:155"/>of God. If there were any viſible beame or glimmerings of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Majeſty of God amongſt his people, his Church might be to the world and enemies of it, as thoſe figures and ſhapes of men are, which husbandmen ſet up in their Corne to skare and keep vermine away, but not to kill them. So, if the world ſaw or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended any thing to be afraid of in the Church, (as any outward teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the preſence of God muſt needs be, that falls within the reach of their underſtandings) this might binde the world to ſome termes of good
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:18542:155"/>behaviour towards them, this might keep violence, and oppreſſion, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from off them, it might keep down deſires within them of doing them harme. But when men ſet Gins or Snares to be the death of Birds of Prey, <hi>Vermine, Beaſts,</hi> or the like, every man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes himſelfe out of ſight as much as may be, and they leave nothing at all, not ſo much as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a man, that lookes like a man, or any part of him, but only the bait as naked as may be, and the ſnare covered; otherwiſe, this would make the Vermine ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and keep away.</p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:18542:156"/>
               <p> So the Lord intending to make the Church a ſnare for the wicked and wretched enemies of it, he muſt wholy withdraw himſelfe, and hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſome ſecret place, where they may not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry him, nor yet ſuſpect him, that ſo being drawn on by their curſed hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and thirſting after the blood of the Church, the Lion may take his advantage, and breake out of the thicket upon them, and teare them in pieces ſuddenly. The truth is, that all holy and conſecrate things are ſnares to the wicked, (as the Scripture ſpeakes it in a particular caſe
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:18542:156"/>
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.25. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.2.) but there is a greater ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the truth of it. It is a ſnare to a man to devoure that which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. His intent is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (nor, as I take it, ſo much) to expreſſe the danger a man falls upon when he hath devoured, that then he ſhall pay deare for it, but further, and more principally to intimate this, that things that are ſanctified and ſet apart to God, are in mens way (as it were) where they may eaſily, and without any viſible dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger come at them, and that there are few that will take heed of devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, whether they
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18542:157"/>be perſons, or things. As ſnares are not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Vermine, when they fall into them or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but they are ſet in the way where they are likely to come, and make moſt bold, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And therefore in the ſixth (and laſt place) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the power, nor the proud and high lookes of the enemy, nor their breathing out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, nor making great boaſts, nor any ground they get from day to day of the Church, nor any cruelty they can practiſe againſt it, or the like, none of all theſe, nor all of them together, are any
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18542:157"/>juſt cauſes of feare to ſuch as are the People of God, and have intereſt in God. Their hearts may be lifted up within them to their deſtruction, as it is ſaid of <hi>Vzziah</hi> when he was <hi>waxen ſtrong,</hi> and great in power, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16.</p>
               <p>When the Jews at Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth (<hi>Luke</hi> 4.29.) had thruſt our Saviour out of their City, and had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him to the edge or brow of the hill, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their City was built, thinking to have made quick diſpatch of him, to have throwne him down headlong, it is ſaid, <hi>Hee paſſed through the midſt of them, and went his way:</hi>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:18542:158"/>he was as ſecure, &amp; never a whit the nearer death when he was upon the very brow and brinke of the hill, then when he was a mile off in a plaine and ſafe place.</p>
               <p>So we are to conceive of the State of the Church, that it is never the nearer deſtruction, for being neare to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<note place="margin">Luke 12.6 Dan. 4.11.</note> (as we count near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) for God may be as far from giving his voice and conſent for the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and deſtruction of it, as at other times, when there is leſſe danger in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: and we know there is nothing done without him. If a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row falls not to the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:18542:158"/>ground without our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father, (as Chriſt ſpake) <hi>without him,</hi> that is, except <hi>he</hi> orders and diſpoſeth of the ſilly Bird accordingly, which yet is of ſo little worth, that <hi>five of them are bought for two farthings:</hi> How ſhall we thinke that the Church of God, which could not bee bought at any under rate, then the precious blood of the Son of God, ſhould fall to the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpeciall hand of God; yea, either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, or with it? For, as it is altogether impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it ſhould fall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, ſo is it very incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible it ſhould fall with it.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18542:159"/>But though it be as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a particular Church to fall to the ground by the hand of God, as it is for a poore Sparrow: yet except there be a voice from heaven calling to men on earth, to hew downe the tree of it, and breake off the branches, (as <hi>Daniels</hi> expreſſion is in another caſe) it is not <hi>Edoms</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>Downe with it, downe with it, even to the ground:</hi> this will not do it, nor bring it ever a whit the lower. Though they ſhould get all the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, and Smiths, and all the world together about the Church, and every man ſtand ready
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18542:159"/>with their Axes ſharpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeven times more keen and ſharp then ordinary; yet ſhall the tree ſtand in the ſight of them all, and laugh the workmen and inſtruments to ſcorne in the face.</p>
               <p>When the enemies of the Church have gotten the greateſt advantage againſt it that can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, yet is the Church no more nearer periſhing, or falling, then the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world was in danger of miſcarrying, when Jeſus Chriſt hung upon the Croſſe, or lay in the Grave: The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of darkneſſe had him at the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, at the loweſt ebbe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:18542:160"/>that ever they had, or are ever like to have him more. True, he upon whom the hope of the world depended, was then at the loweſt ſtep of his humiliation, he was fully emptied, and had nothing left: But hee went downe ſo low, only to take his riſe (as it were) to mount up the higher and to carry all up on high with him: and he was never nearer his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, nor the world its ſalvation, then when he lay at the loweſt point of his humiliation.</p>
               <p>Such is the condition of the Church, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver nearer the glory, and beauty, and full ſtrength
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:18542:160"/>of it, then when it ſeemes to be moſt forſaken of God. As Chriſt was then ready (and never till then) to enter into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, when he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Ought not Chriſt to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer (ſaith he himſelf) and ſo immediatly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, upon his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to enter into his glory? So when the Church is readieſt to cry out, and complain of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>forſaken,</hi> this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and cry is the greateſt ſigne of the time of the Churches Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe at hand. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelfe hath given us this ſigne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:18542:161"/>it is a foundation that will beare a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of greater weight and worth then a conjecture or a hopefull probability of ſuch a thing; you may caſt your ſoules upon it, and not feare. <hi>When the Son of man commeth,</hi> viz. to avenge his People and Church of their enemies, <hi>Shall he finde Faith upon earth?

Is that man of ſin, and all his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates with him, all that have been baptized in the ſpirit of that fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are they afraid and of doubtfull and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative thoughts, whether

Are they afraid they ſhall
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:18542:167"/>periſh and be deſtroyed, but after the common manner of other men, and that their deſtruction ſhall not come upon them with a ſufficient glory of terrour and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or (as <hi>Eſaies</hi> expreſſion is) like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,

               <p>Surely (my Brethren) the tenour and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their malice, and hatred againſt the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the living God, and glorious Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt: Their Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, their Fires, their Swords, their Poyſons, their Whips, their Ships, their Vaults, their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, their Billets, their Barres, theſe and ſuch like ſtrange things and doings of theirs, being interpreted in the plaine language which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaketh, are as much as to ſay, we would not fall, or be deſtroyed after the dull manner of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:18542:168"/>other Kingdomes of the earth: we would have the day of our vengeance celebrated with more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of horrour; we ſhall not be ſatisfied with our deſtruction, except the powers of heaven and earth be ſhaken together at the terrour of it. If ſuch a deſire were indeed and in truth to be found in theſe men, and in their religion, if it were a reall deſigne and project a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, to procure another hell to be created for them, by themſelves, beneath the nethermoſt hell that is now extant, wherein they might have more cruell tormentors then devills, a more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:18542:169"/>manner, as they doe, to fall upon the rereward of the Hoſts of heaven (for ſo may the Saints on earth be well termed: they are called Angels in the Revelation, for that communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they have with the Angels, in fighting Chriſts battailes here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath) then by ſeeking to roote out the generation of the righteous from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven, then by grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and afflicting the ſoules that have that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious intereſt in God.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond motive to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:18542:169"/>perſwade the enemies of the Church of God to ſtay their hands, and to give over that ſervice of the devill, <hi>perſecuting Saints,</hi> may be this: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a worke that never proſpered in the hands of any, from the beginning of the world till this day: but ſtill hath been a work, like <hi>the Land of Canaan,</hi> as the ſpies deſcribed it to the people, (<hi>Num.</hi> 13.32.) <hi>that eates up the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of it.</hi> So this work of perſecuting the Church and Children of God, hath ever been a worke and imployment that hath been the ruine and deſtruction of the doers
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:18542:170"/>of it. Yea, the ſharpeſt and ſoreſt contentions that ever fell betweene heaven and earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the men of this world, have ſtill riſen about injuries and violence offered to his Church. This apple of Gods eye hath coſt the world deare: The tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of it hath coſt the blood of the greateſt Monarchs, of many Kings and Princes of the earth. It hath coſt whole Monarchies, Kingdomes, and States, the greateſt, the richeſt, the ſtrongeſt that ever the world ſaw, their whole Eſtates, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Glory, and Peace. True, we reade often of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:18542:170"/>the jealouſie of God over his great name, in reſpect of any pollutions, and prophanation of it by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins; but we do not reade of his <hi>great</hi> jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, but only for, and over Jeruſalem, his Church: but as concerning the caſe of Jeruſalem, wee reade of it twice in the ſame Prophet, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.14.8.2. As if God had <hi>a jealouſie,</hi> and <hi>a jealouſie,</hi> a two-fold jealouſie, a double, and a ſingle, a greater, and a leſſe; and the leſſer jealouſie he puts on, and armes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with, when he went forth to execute venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for other ſins; but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſets forth againſt
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:18542:171"/>the enemies of his Church, when he comes to plead Jeruſalems cauſe with her adverſaries, his double jealouſie now went on, his great jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie was reſerved for cauſes of this nature, as of higheſt and greateſt importance for his glory. Yea, I ſhall ſay yet more, that when men have put forth their hands to this worke, I meane to afflict the Church of God, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the faireſt termes, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on greateſt advantage, or likelihood that can be conceived, of doing any good upon it, and making earnings of it: I meane when they have ſeemed in doing it, even to give
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:18542:171"/>the right hand of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to God himſelfe, when he hath begun to puniſh them, yet did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any man come off fairely from the worke; God ſtill found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other againſt thoſe that were his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and executioners, which made a breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and them: they never eate of their labours, nor ever rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in any of theſe works of their hand, ſeldome any of their heads went downe in peace to their Graves.</p>
               <p>An inſtance hereof we may ſee in the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (according to the Lords owne prediction
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:18542:172"/>long before, how it would fall out) Know for a ſurety, ſaith the Lord to <hi>Abraham, (Gen.</hi> 15.13, 14.) that thy ſeed ſhall be a ſtranger in a Land that is not theirs, and ſhall ſerve them, and they ſhall afflict them foure hundred yeares: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Nation whom they ſhall ferve, will I judge, &amp;c. And that God did not only foreſee and foretell this, that the Iſraelites ſhould ſerve the Aegyptians, and be in bondage, but that himſelfe had a ſpeciall hand in it, in bringing it to paſſe; it is evident from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.25. where it is ſaid, that God turned
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:18542:172"/>their heart (<hi>i. e.</hi> the heart of the Aegyptians) to hate his people, and to deale craftily with his ſervants: becauſe they began now to be corrupted in Aegypt, and to diſpleaſe him; God tooke off the good will and the affections of the Aegyptians from them: and yet we know how deare the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans paid for that worke and ſervice the Iſraelites did them; they had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have given double &amp; treble wages to other men to have made their Bricks, then to have the people of God make them for nothing.</p>
               <p>Other inſtances of like nature you may finde in
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:18542:173"/>Scripture,
<note place="margin">Eſa. 36.20</note> if you reade <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.61.2. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.8. you ſhall finde a paſſage of like impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Rabſheka</hi> (it is like) lyed, or at leaſt ſpake up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a groundleſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, <hi>viz.</hi> (becauſe till then he had proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) when he told <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kia's</hi> meſſengers, that he was not come againſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem without the Lord (God had ſaid to him, deſtroy it.) But in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babel,</hi> the caſe is plaine, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.17. it is ſaid expreſly, that God brought upon them the King of the Caldeans: yet if you reade <hi>Ier.</hi> 50.17, 18. (beſides many
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:18542:173"/>other places) you ſhall finde he had his wages paid him in ſorrow and deſolation. Iſrael is ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered as Sheep, the Lions have driven him away. Firſt, the King of Aſſyria hath devoured him, and laſt, this <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of Babylon hath broken his bones. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſrael, Behold, I will puniſh the King of Babylon, and his Land, as I have puniſhed the King of Aſſyria, &amp;c. So <hi>Iudges</hi> 3.12. you may reade the like of <hi>Eglon</hi> King of Moab; it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, that God ſtrengthened his hand againſt Iſrael, &amp;c. yet
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:18542:174"/>we know this medling with Iſrael was his ruine.</p>
               <p>As for example, of the juſt vengeance and fiery indignation of the Lord breaking out, upon thoſe, who without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or commiſſion from him, have evill intreated, deſpitefully uſed, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and perſecuted the Church of God, theſe both in ſacred Records, and other Hiſtories of the Church, are without end or number. There is not only a Cloud of ſuch witneſſes, but the whole heaven is ſpread over with them, and divers of them known unto all men; So that it would be but time loſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them.</p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:18542:174"/>
               <p> Therefore now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you conſider, you that are enemies of the truth, that have imbitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirits againſt the holy City and Church of God, conſider and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with your ſelves the truth and weight of this motive. There was no man ever ſpread a ſnare, to take the People of God with, but firſt or laſt, if he continued his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, his owne foot was taken with it. No man ever digged a Pit for ſuch, but fell himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; no man ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted miſchief againſt it, and continued in it, but it ſtill returned upon him, and fell on his own pate,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:18542:175"/>(as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh.) It was the argument the Lord Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe uſed to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he tooke him hard at this worke, buſie in perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Saints, and meant to take him off from it: <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> (Act. 9.5.) <hi>It is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks,</hi>

               <p>But the argument wherewith the Holy Ghoſt now preſſeth upon you, to have no more to doe againſt theſe men, is of greater efficacy: not only one woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered many things in a

               <p>To let all other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces paſſe; only to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that fiery ſtorme and tempeſt, which was the portion of thoſe wretches to drink, whoſe workes and wages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, occaſioned the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of this day. Is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:18542:176"/>not the Lord knowne by executing judgement? were not theſe wicked ones ſnared in the workes of their own hands? (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.16.) Are they not peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as dung from the face of the earth? Was not that ſtone they hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and liſted at, to have removed out of its place, too heavy for them? did it not recoile upon them, and cruſh them to pieces? There wanted nothing that can be imagined, that might cauſe the deviſe to proſper in their hands. It was a deſigne and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in all the parts and members of it, ſo framed and faſhioned, with that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:18542:177"/>exquiſiteneſſe of cunning and circumſpection; that for a deſigne, it was in the eyes of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it, as <hi>beautifull</hi> as <hi>Abſolon</hi> is ſaid to have been, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.25. <hi>From the ſole of his foote, to the top of his head,</hi> (ſaith the Text) there was no blemiſh in him. There was nothing to be found about it, that feare or jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie it ſelfe could take hold of, but that it would bring forth, it would doe the deed. Surely the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it were as much taken with the beauty and comelineſſe of it, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was with that <hi>golden Image</hi> he ſet up in the plain of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:18542:177"/>
                  <hi>Dura;</hi> they fell downe before it, and even wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped it. What is the matter then, how came it to paſſe, or what ſtrange thing was there in it, that it proved like Corne upon the houſe top, that it did not fill the boſome of the Actors and Authors of it? Why did it not make the Popes triple Crowne to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh? Why did it not raiſe the glory and name of the Popiſh Religion up to the heavens? Mee thinkes I may ſpeake to it after ſuch a manner, as <hi>David</hi> ſpake to, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulates the matter with the <hi>red Sea,</hi> and the <hi>River Iordan,</hi> and the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:18542:178"/>Mountaines, and the Hils, <hi>What aileſt thee thou Sea,</hi>

               <p>So muſt I expoſtulate the matter with this deep project, I cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:18542:178"/>without it; we muſt know the myſtery of the thing; What ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledſt thou, thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, deſperate, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-project, that thou broughteſt nothing to paſſe? What ſo many Barrels of Gunpowder, ſo many Barres of Iron, ſo many Loades of Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, ſo many roodes of Faggots, ſuch a Vault, ſo many politique Heads in thee, ſo many hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thee night and day, ſo many prayers made over thee, and nothing of moment, no great, or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thing done, no Kingdomen brought to ruine, no Nation trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the peace of no

What ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledſt thee, thou Vault, thou Gunpowder, you Barres of Iron, you Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of wood, you Heads, you Hands, that you ſhooke not the world round about you? that you turned not three Kingdomes (at leaſt) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down? Have you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be miſchievous, to teare, to kill, to ruine, to deſtroy, to work deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation upon the earth? Certainly it was as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature and ſpirit that wrought in this project, not to have
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:18542:179"/>brought all this to paſſe, as it was either for the Sea to flee, or for Jordan to run back, or for the mountaines to leape, or for the Hills to skip. But <hi>David</hi> by putting this queſtion upon theſe poor creatures, to make them aſſoile their owne rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, did but only (by a ſweete Metaphoricall ſtraine) prepare the way, to ſet off his owne an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with the more grace and advantage. He did not expect they ſhould anſwer him to his queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but he anſwers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and tells us, what the Sea, and what the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, &amp; what the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and what the Hils
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:18542:180"/>ayled. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. The earth trembled at the preſence of the Lord; at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the God of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob:</hi> that was all the ail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they had. The Sea would have done as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seas doe, and Jordan would have kept on his courſe as other Rivers doe, and the Mountaines would have ſtood as faſt, and the Hills been as quiet, as other Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Hills uſe to be, but that the dreadfull preſence of God was amongſt them, they would not have denied themſelves in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor gone out of their way, for all the world beſides: So, if you would
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:18542:180"/>know what this project of hell ayled, what was the diſeaſe and infirmity of it, that according to the nature of it, it did not ſhake the foundations of our Land, that it did not aſtoniſh all hearts, and make all hands hang downe, and knees feeble, that it did not bring a day of darkneſſe upon the Church and people of God, and the Goſpell amongſt us; in a word, it was only this, it was a deviſe againſt the Lord, and againſt his Church, and People; And we know the Scripture ſaith, that there is no wiſdome, nor underſtanding, nor counſel againſt the Lord,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:18542:181"/>nor any inchantment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iacob,</hi> nor ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying againſt Iſrael, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.31. <hi>Nam.</hi> 23.23. <hi>i. e.</hi> Both wiſdome, and counſell, and inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, projects from the earth, and projects from hell, they are not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they loſe their proper vertue and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they are bent againſt the Lord and againſt his people: They will deale in this caſe with the Authors of them, as <hi>Balaam</hi> ſerved <hi>Balak; Balak</hi> ſent for him and hired him, <hi>to curſe the people of God,</hi> but <hi>he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them altogether;</hi> So the policy and wiſdome that were in this plot, the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:18542:181"/>Vault, the Powder, the Barres, the Billets, the Faggots, theſe were all hired to curſe the Church and People of God amongſt us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, they have bleſſed us altogether. They have filled our mouthes with laughter this day, and are a ſong of praiſe, and thankſgiving in our mouthes to the Name of our God.</p>
               <p>If ſuch a project had been managed againſt Babylon, or the enemies of God, there it is like, every creature, every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument about it would have done its part, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome would have beene wiſdome, and Policy
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:18542:182"/>have been policy, the Powder would have been ready to have fired alone, and Barres of Iron would have torne all in pieces. There is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God for theſe creatures to feare and tremble at; and for the preſence of any other, they would not regard it. As we ſee by that one creature, the Powder, that when there was none in preſence, but of thoſe bloody wretches; (though it was not mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt them, by any hand or underſtanding of man, nay, (on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) it was (as it were) charged to doe them no harme, there was their
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:18542:182"/>owne eye and care upon it, that it ſhould not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them) yet on the ſudden, remembring it ſelfe (as it were) it tooke fire and deſtroyed them.</p>
               <p>So that (me thinkes) this fiery Element of Powder ſpake to, and dealt betweene them (theſe Popiſh miſcreants) and us, the Church of God amongſt us, much after the ſame manner as the evill ſpirit mentioned (<hi>Acts</hi> 19.15.) both ſpake and dealt by thoſe Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond Jewes, thoſe Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſts, in reſpect of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> When theſe Exorciſts adjured this evill ſpirit, by Jeſus, whom <hi>Paul</hi> preached, the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:18542:183"/>ſpirit anſwered and ſaid to them, <hi>Ieſus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye? And the man</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>in whom the evill ſpirit was, ran on them, and they fled out of the houſe, naked and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> So when theſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Exorciſts had adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and charged the Powder to doe execution upon this Kingdome, and State, profeſſing the truth and Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt, the Powder made them anſwer; The State and Church of England, I know, the ſervants of the living God. I know, thoſe that worſhip the Lord Chriſt in Spirit and truth, I know; I have
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:18542:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>nothing to doe with theſe, I can doe nothing againſt them; but who are you, you curſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of truth, &amp; Church of God?

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe your fleſh will be before me, but as ſtubble before the winde: I will devoure you. But this for the ſecond mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to perſwade enemies to deſiſt; it is a worke that never hath, (and therefore certainly never will) proſper, but only to deſtruction of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers themſelves.</p>

                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:18542:184"/>Let this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration alſo prevaile with the enemies of the Church, to cauſe them to ceaſe from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that is in their hand againſt it; becauſe this Church of God, and the members of it, whom they perſecute, living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them in the world, are the rock (as it were) upon which their City is built; they are the foundations of all the peace, and all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and all the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they enjoy upon earth: theſe are the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition wall between them and hell for the time. Theſe are the Chariots and Horſemen for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:18542:184"/>and faſeguard of their States and Lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fury and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Lord, which otherwiſe would breake in upon them, and conſume them in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The great Maſter houſholder of this great houſe, the world, would ſoon break up houſe if his owne Children were once diſpoſed of in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, to their great huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. If theſe were once ſetled in their inheritance the wicked would ſoone (with <hi>Iudas</hi>) be packed away, and ſent every man to his owne place. When God ſhall once ſpeake, <hi>come</hi> yee bleſſed; <hi>depart</hi> ye curſed, followes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:18542:185"/>ſently after it: The Chaffe is not in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of burning, as long as it lies in the ſame heap; intermixt with the Wheat: but if the Wheat be once divided by it ſelf from it, then it is neare the burning with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable fire.</p>
               <p>It is true, that which our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45. God makes his Sun to ariſe upon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and the good, but with this interpretation, and in this order, (as one gloſſeth the place well) he makes the Sun to ariſe upon the evill and the good, but upon the evill, for the goods ſake. And that manner of ſpeaking
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:18542:185"/>(I take it) is much to be noted, where it is ſaid that <hi>God</hi> maketh his Sun to riſe upon evill and good. <hi>(q. d.)</hi> If God himſelfe did not mediate and interpoſe with a ſtrong hand, betweene that glorious creature of his, the <hi>Sun,</hi> and evill and wicked men, they would never agree for an houre together, the Sun being once ſet, would never riſe upon ſuch men again. There is a naturall unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe and gainſaying in the whole Creation, in the <hi>Heavens, Sun, Moone,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> to doe any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to, or to gratifie wicked men, that are enemies to God, though
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:18542:186"/>otherwiſe it be moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar natures, to give forth their light, and influences to the world, and they may ſeem to rejoyce (as it were) and triumph to doe it: yet ſince man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt God, that created him, through that naturall ſympathy they have with God and his glory, there is an utter averſneſſe and unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon them, even to doe that office and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the world, for which they were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and are able freely to afford without any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, hinderance, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to themſelves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. But that which
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:18542:186"/>is their glory, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent light and luſtre, and thoſe heavenly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences they give downe, upon the world, in this reſpect is not their glory, but a griefe and burden upon them, to pleaſure the enemies of God with them, and to ſtrengthen their hand: as if through a zeale they have to Gods glory, they would rather loſe their beeing, though excellent, and glorious, then to remain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue doing ſervice to his enemies. So that, did not God over-rule them in the thing by a ſtrong hand, the Sun would preſently clothe himſelfe with a ſackcloth, the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:18542:187"/>Moone would give over ſhining, and the Stars would fall out of their place in heaven, rather then ſhine here to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the enemies of their God.</p>
               <p>This I rather take to be the meaning of that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20. Becauſe <hi>the creature is ſubject to vanity,</hi> not of its owne will, but by reaſon of him, <hi>that hath ſubdued it under hope.</hi> That <hi>vanity</hi> whereunto the creature is ſaid to be here <hi>ſubject,</hi> is not to be underſtood of a vanity of corruption pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, or diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for it is a great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether it be at all ſubject to this vanity or
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:18542:187"/>no, whether in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens (which are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall parts of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) there ſhall be any ſuch change that ſhall anſwer the death and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of man. It is hard to conceive, how the heavens ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with a condition more glorious, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, then that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they now ſtand; which ſeemes neceſſary to be held, and to bee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if we hold any ſuch change comming upon them, anſwerable to death. What God is able to doe in this caſe, we do not here diſpute, or deny.</p>
               <p>And againe ſecondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> if it were this kinde of
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:18542:188"/>vanity, the holy Ghoſt ſhould here meane, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Apoſtle would never have mentioned that circumſtance, as a matter ſo weighty and worthy of conſideration, that it ſhould be contrary to the will of it. For, who knowes not that corruption and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall deſire and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? therfore thoſe words would taſte too flat and dry for the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the holy Ghoſt, if ſuch a ſenſe were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> (and laſtly) the vanity here meant, muſt be ſuch a vanity,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:18542:188"/>from the ſubjection whereof the creature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth even for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and that with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, to be free, and to be delivered, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. Now from the vanity of corruption properly ſo called, it cannot be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but by undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſuffering corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion firſt; and ſo it would follow, that the fervent deſire of the creature, ſhould be unto diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; corruption, though not as the end, yet as the meanes: whereas wee know corruption in that ſenſe, whether conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as end, or meanes, is contrary to the deſire, much more the fervent
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:18542:189"/>deſire of every creature. Therefore the vanity whereunto the creature is here ſaid to be ſubject, and to be ſubdued unto, <hi>viz.</hi> by the over-ruling hand and power of God, ſeems rather to be meant of a vanity in their ſervice and labour, implying that they doe otherwiſe then they have a minde to doe, or then ſtands with their owne inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and ſo it is to be taken rather for a vanity of ſorrow, then of muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which is called a bondage of corruption, (<hi>ver.</hi> 21.) either becauſe to be thus ſubdued and held to it by God, to ſerve his enemies, it is to
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:18542:189"/>the creature as unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and bitter, as a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage unto corruption, or becauſe ſuch a ſubjection doth ſtaine and corrupt the glory of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. (Notwithſtanding it is the pleaſure of God ſo to have it for a ſeaſon, and in reſpect of that hope God hath given it, that it ſhall ſhortly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, the creature is well content with it, it is no vanity to it, in either of theſe reſpects.)</p>
               <p>Now if queſtion be made, Wherefore doth God ſubdue the creature to vanity (in this ſenſe) and compells it to ſerve and comfort wicked and ſinfull men: One maine
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:18542:190"/>reaſon is this. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Children upon the way of their Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and he hath more to ſucceed them for a while. But if theſe were once all through the Wilderneſſe of this world, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into their glorious reſt, God would deliver the creature from the bondage mentioned: it ſhall no more miniſter to the children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but ſhall be reſtored into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God, it ſhall be as free from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſinfull men, as theſe in the ſtate of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:18542:190"/>ſhall be free from obeying any ſinfull cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p>Therefore thoſe that ſeek to take away the lives of the Saints of God, they make the foundations of the round world, to reele, &amp; totter, and ſtagger, and attempt to ſhake the pillars of heaven and earth. They doe, as if a man ſhould undermine, and dig down the foundations of the houſe he dwells in, to cauſe it to fall on his head, and thoſe that were with him. We ſee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt <hi>Lot</hi> was in <hi>Sodome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 9.22</note> 
                  <hi>Sodome</hi> was in <hi>Lot,</hi> (i. e.) the ſafety and peace of <hi>Sodome</hi> was in <hi>Lot: I can
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:18542:191"/>doe nothing</hi> (ſaith the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell to him, meaning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the deſtruction of the City) <hi>till thou beeſt gone out of it,</hi> and haſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Sanctuary. Now ſuppoſe the men of the City had perſecuted <hi>Lot,</hi> and thruſt him out of their City before this (as words brake out that way; they were talking of ſuch a matter, <hi>ver.</hi> 9.) had not the ſtorme and tempeſt of the fiery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the Lord, come ſwifter upon them then it did? <hi>Except thoſe daies were ſhortned</hi> (ſaith our Saviour of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Jeruſalem) <hi>no fleſh could be ſaved, but for the Elects ſake theſe daies ſhall
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:18542:191"/>be ſhortened.</hi> Mat. 24.22.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the mercies and good things wicked men enjoy in this world, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theſe dayes were lengthened and prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there could none of theſe mercies be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but for the elect and righteous mens ſakes, theſe dayes are lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> makes a ſolemne and ſad obſervation upon it, that righteous men ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and ſo few conſider it, and lay it to heart, <hi>Eſay</hi> 57.1. <hi>The righteous periſheth, and no man lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to heart, &amp;c.</hi> as if it were a thing of neare
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:18542:192"/>concernment, and to be taken much to heart, when a righteous mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is cut off from the body of any State, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men: and yet of the two, it is a thing much more to be laid to heart, that ſuch a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man ſhould be thruſt our, by men themſelves, from amongſt them, or loſe his life by their hand, then if God ſhould take him away by death; It is true in both caſes, it is likely he is taken away from the evill to come; but in the former, when men deſtroy the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous from amongſt them, the evil to come, is like to come both more ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:18542:192"/>&amp; more heavily upon thoſe that are left. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that perſecute the Saints of God, they call for fire (as it were) downe from heaven, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their owne heads; they put a ſword into the Lords hand wherewith to ſlay them. If that Scarlet Whore of Rome had been, or ever ſhould be able to performe, the deviſe ſhe imagined, and yet imagines daily, to roote out all the holy Seed, the whole family that is deſcended of Jeſus Chriſt in all the world, ſo that ſhe had left none but her owne adulterous ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to poſſeſſe the earth, ſhe might then
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:18542:193"/>thinke indeed that ſhe ſate like a Queen; but the truth is, ſhe ſhould have prevented her judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and torments ſo much the ſooner; Shee had but brought the feare and dread of the devill, which was, <hi>To be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before his time,</hi> ſo much the more ſpeedily upon his owne head. Suppoſe the Lord had given us up into their bloody hands, (which yet we and our poſterity ſhall have cauſe to bleſſe him ſo long as the Sunne and Moone indures, that it was far from all his thoughts to doe) but put caſe (I ſay) that ſhe had been let alone, with
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:18542:193"/>State, People, Goſpell, Religion, that ſhe might have done with all theſe, as it is ſaid, the Jewes did by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 17.12</note> even what ſhe liſt, that ſhe had triumphed in that fatall blow: for ought that ſhe knew or was aware of, ſhe might have ſhaken the foundations of her owne Mountaines, and have cauſed her Sun to have ſet over her head, even at noone dayes: ſhe might have thundered, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt out of heaven, to have taken ſpeedy ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon thoſe that would bring up hell from beneath, upon the face of the earth, and that had
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:18542:194"/>deſtroyed out of the world the beauty and glory of it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> (and laſtly) this conſideration alſo, may prevaile with the enemies of the Church, and People of God, to cauſe them to deſiſt from perſecuting the Saints, from attempting and plotting evill againſt them, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lift up a hand againſt theſe, but in a way of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe &amp; wrong. They are called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>The generation of the righteous,</hi> and their waies are <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> therefore whoever ſhall touch any of theſe, to doe them any harme,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18542:194"/>to afflict, or bring evill upon them, cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, but injuſtice and violence will be found in his hands.</p>
               <p>Many of thoſe that are the ſoureſt enemies of the Church, and that beare a tyrannicall and invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hatred againſt the Saints, are men, that for Morall honeſty and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſtand upon termes of honour and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thinke it their great glory that they waſh their hands in clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner innocency then other men. <hi>Decius</hi> and <hi>Trajan,</hi> two of the beſt and moſt moderate, and juſt <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> otherwiſe, raiſed as cruell ſtormes of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:18542:195"/>againſt Chriſtians, as others that were ſeven times more looſe and brutiſh. So you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve many amongſt us, that ſtand ſtrictly upon a ſtreightneſſe and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Morall honeſty, &amp; doing no man wrong, that will tythe <hi>Mint,</hi> and <hi>Aniſe,</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> very truly and exactly, who yet carry the gall of Aſpes under their lips, to caſt it forth upon the Children of God when they ſee their time, and are alwayes in travell of miſchiefe againſt them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe high Prieſts and Phariſees, that hunted after the precious life of our Saviour, were men
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:18542:195"/>that began to expoſtulate with <hi>Pilate</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and to take it ill at his hands, that he would not ſo far honour and adore their integrity and uprightneſſe, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt Chriſt as an evill doer, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other ground, why he ſhould proceed againſt him, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch honeſt and juſt men as they, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him unto him. <hi>Pilate</hi> then went out, and ſaid, <hi>What accuſation bring you againſt this man?</hi> They anſwered and ſaid unto him; <hi>If he were not an evill doer, wee would not have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him up unto thee,</hi>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:18542:196"/>John 18.29, 30. And it may be theſe very bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thoughts and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſuch men againſt the Goſpell, may be a bridle in the jawes of their unrighteous and baſe diſpoſitions, and luſt otherwiſe, and keep them from any notorious breaking out in other caſes: They may by this meanes, the better co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour over, and cover with a Cloake of civill honeſty, the foulneſſe of their hatred and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practiſes againſt holy men.</p>
               <p>I remember, one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves well, how the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane State of old labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſhadow and hide
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:18542:196"/>from the view of the world (as well as they could) a foule and baſe practiſe of theirs. They had an evill eye upon <hi>Ptolomies</hi> great wealth and treaſury (as they had heard it to be) and they knew not well how, or upon what pretence to invade and ſeiſe upon it, becauſe <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was a friend and confederate with their State: Friend or foe, they were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to loſe ſuch a booty, and becauſe they would put the beſt face upon the buſineſſe they could, they made <hi>Cato,</hi> who was the great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of Juſtice in their State, to be the <hi>Pablicus
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:18542:197"/>Praedo,</hi> to be the great thiefe that ſhould make the ſpoile for them, <hi>Vt ſumma turpitudo facti, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate viri aliquantu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum tegeretur,</hi> (ſaith my Author) That the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous baſeneſſe of the fact might be a little over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed by the credit and authority of the man that was the principall actor in it.</p>
               <p>So I verily beleeve that the deſires and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions that many men have, to oppreſſe the Church of God, and to roote out the holy Seed from the earth, and to do it in a more creditable way, that they might be thought to doe nothing
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:18542:197"/>but that which is juſt and right, and be counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by the world in their deed, keepes many in awe, from breaking out into many other baſe and notorious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes. Who knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe <hi>two thiefes</hi> ſhould have been crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and put to death at all (but eſpecially at that time, when our Saviour was crucified) had it not been to make a pretence, and beare the world in hand, that there was the ſame juſtice and equity uſed in crucifying him in the midſt, that was in putting to death thoſe on either hand? But not to ſtand further upon this.</p>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:18542:198"/>
               <p> Therefore now, let ſuch men as either intend or practiſe evill againſt the Church of God, or any member of it, if they be worſhippers of the goddeſſe <hi>Civill juſtice,</hi> let them know and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they ſhall but blaſpheme this <hi>goddeſſe</hi> of theirs, by attempting any thing againſt theſe men; in ſtead of waſhing their hands in innocency, they ſhall now waſh them in innocent blood. For theſe are men that live peaceably by them, and doe them no harme, they take no mans Oxe, nor Aſſe from them, they are no enemies to the Civill peace, and ſociety of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:18542:198"/>men; they are no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbers of the publique affaires of States and Kingdomes: Nay, they pray for the People and State whereſoever they live; and they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with heaven, with the King of kings, who makes earthly Crownes to flouriſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heads of Princes, and who watcheth over Kingdomes and Nations for good, for the wealth and peace of the places where they live.</p>
               <p>Therefore let their enemies know (whoever they be) that they cannot but be unrighteous, and unjuſt in all their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes againſt them; <hi>Have
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:18542:199"/>thou nothing to doe with that juſt man,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> wife to him) It is a terrible thing to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure out unrighteous and hard meaſure to him that is juſt. It is reported by ſome, that the Jewes till this day impute that grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous judgement of God that hath lyen ſo heavy upon their Nation, for ſo many generations, from the deſtruction of their City, Temple, and State, to the death of <hi>Simeon</hi> the juſt. They may truly impute it to the death and murther of one that was juſt indeed. But him they ſhall not acknowledge to be juſt till the time comes, wherein they
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:18542:199"/>ſhall ſee him whom they have pierced.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Stephen</hi> ſought to aggravate the ſin of thoſe that put Chriſt to death, and to repreſent it unto their conſciences in the full proportion of it, that they might the more eaſily apprehend it, and conſider of it, he calls them <hi>the murtherers, and betrayers of that juſt One.</hi> Acts 7.52. And <hi>Peter</hi> in like manner ſaith,
<note place="margin">Act. 3.14.</note>

                  <hi>Many good workes</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to the Jewes) <hi>have I ſhewed you from my Father;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 10.32</note> 
                  <hi>For which of theſe workes doe you ſtone me?</hi> Implying, that they could have no other reaſon, to proceed with violence againſt him, but only the good
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:18542:201"/>he had done amongſt them. So may the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, State, and People, againſt which theſe fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands of hell breathed out nothing but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found death, ruine, and confuſion, ſay unto them, They have done you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good offices, for which of them muſt they be deſtroyed, by ſuch a barbarous and unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an deſtruction? They have nouriſhed and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured you in their land, they have ſought the converſion and ſalvation of your ſoules, they have pardoned and paſſed by many foule and wicked practiſes of men of your party and faction before;
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:18542:202"/>and have not executed the juſt ſeverity of the Lawes upon them; they have been tender of their lives, and ſought every way to doe them good. It muſt be for ſome of theſe, that the horrible pit of deſtruction muſt be prepared againſt us; the Gun-powder, and Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and Barres of Iron muſt take vengeance on ſome good worke or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: other unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, other provocation againſt us can there none be found.</p>
               <p>But as it was true, that the Jewes did ſeeke to ſtone our Saviour to death for ſome, or all thoſe good workes hee
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:18542:202"/>had ſhewed them, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they rejected ſuch a charge with deep indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; for thy good workes we ſtone thee not, but for blaſphemy: and <hi>Eſay</hi> prophecied as much (in effect) long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.9.33. And he made his Grave with the wicked: he, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Jewes, made his Grave with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with the rich and honourable they did ſeek to ſhame him, and yet honoured him about his death and buriall; the one they did out of their owne wicked and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſpoſition againſt him, the other was done by them by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:18542:203"/>hand of God; and both that which they did according to their owne deſires, and that which God cauſed to be done according to his deſire, had the ſame ground and reaſon in the perſon of our Saviour, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had done no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, neither was there any deceit found in his mouth: the Jewes they could not endure his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite holineſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and therefore they laboured to quench the ſpirit of the glory of it, and ſought to diſgrace it; God on the other ſide, he could not endure to ſee ſuch abſolute inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency altogether ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:18542:203"/>and therefore he would honor him: and ſo they came to divide the matter between them: (as <hi>Eſay</hi> excellently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it) but evident it is from this place, that it was his perfect integrity, and uprightneſſe that drew out the malice of their ſpirits againſt him; ſo doubtleſſe it was the holineſſe, and purity of the Religion and people againſt whoſe faces that dreadfull engine of death was chiefly bent, that both enraged the curſed ſpirits of theſe men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and that drew that gracious and glorious deliverance out of the hand of God unto them.</p>
